<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>I <em>Do not dedicate this piece of my Labours unto you, thereby
to beg protection for it, as fearing either its weakness,
or the malevolent censures of the ignorant; for
I very well know, and have experienced, that it is the
usual property of idle and pragmatical persons to please their
own malignant humors, with the condemning and scoffing
at the painful lucubrations of others. And I have ever judged
that nothing ought to be published, that like a Noun Substantive
cannot stand by it self, without being supported by any
other adjoined help. Neither is this forth of a vain confidence
or an over-weening of mine own abilities, though I very well
know that some are as much in love with the brood of their
own brains, as others are with the fruit of their loines: Because
I have for many years been as wary and vigilant, as any
could be, to watch over my self, that I might both know, and
keep a clear distinction, betwixt flattering Phantasie, and true
and sound judgment. But I shall in brief shew you the true
reasons of my presenting of this poor piece to your reading
and judgments.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>1. <em>The first reason is, because you have all been Gentlemen,
not only well known unto me for many years, as being
my near Neighbours, but also with whom I have been freely
admitted to a Noble and Generous converse, and have been
trusted, and honoured by you in your Domestick concerns,
wherein by my Medical Profession, I might be serviceable to
you, or your Families, far beyond my poor Merit and Desert.
And having been for many years a due observer of your deportments
in your places of trust as Magistrates, for being but
as a stander by, and looking on, may (perhaps) have noted
as much, as those that are Gamesters, I was moved to present
this piece of my labours unto you, by reason of that knowledge
and acquaintance, rather than to others, whose abilities and
integrity I did not so well understand. And (I hope) I may
without suspicion of flattery (of which I am sure both your
selves, and others that know me, will acquit me, that if I
be any way guilty, it is rather in being too plain and open)
say, that you have been, and are true Patriots to your Countrey,
and not only Justices of the Peace, but true conservers of
it, and Peace-makers amongst all your Neighbours; and really
this is one of the chief causes why I have dedicated this Treatise
unto you.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>2. <em>Another reason is, you have all fully known me, and
the most of the particulars of my life, both my follies and
frailties, as also my other endowments and abilities, and therefore
in reference to these, I thought none more fit than your
selves, to whom I might tender this laborious piece. For it
is not unknown unto you, that (excepting my Physical Practice,
which age and infirmities will not suffer me very much
to attend) I have for many years last past lived a solitary,
and sedentary life, <span class='blackletter'>mihi &#38; Musis</span>, having had more converse
with the dead than the living, that is, more with Books
than with Men. And therefore I present this unto you, as being
better able than most others to whom I am unknown, to
judge what I am like or able to perform in such a subject as
this is.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>3. <em>Also it is not unknown unto you, that I have had a
large portion of Trouble and Persecution in this outward
world, wherein you did not like many others stand aloof off,
as though you had not known me, but like persons of Justice,
and true Magnanimity, durst both look upon and assist wronged
innocency, though besmeered over with the envious dirt
of malicious scandals, and even in that very conjuncture of
time, when the whole giddy Troop of barking Dogs, and ravenous
Wolves, did labour to devour me. But then, even
then did put to your helping hands, and were free to declare,
what you knew of mine innocency: which was so Generous,
Noble and Christian a kind of just commiseration, that I
should for ever account my self a wretched person, if I should
not have deeply impressed in my breast and memory, which
no time, nor adversity can ever obliterate. But being in a condition
that I may truly say with the Apostle <span class='blackletter'>S. Peter</span>, <span lang="grc">Αργύειον κ
χρυσίον ὐπάρχ μος</span>, <span class='blackletter'>Silver and Gold have I none</span> (which I
know you expect not) and therefore the greatest power I have
is my weak pen, thereby to testifie my thankfulness for your
unparallel’d kindness. And therefore I offer this Treatise as a
perpetual and monumental memorial to all Posterities, of my
gratitude, and your goodness.</em></p>

<p class='c008'><em>And further, to whom can a subject of this nature be more
suitably and fitly presented than to such Magistrates as your
selves, who have often occasion to be cumbred and troubled
with the ignorant, envious, and sometimes knavish accusations
against people suspected of Witchcraft, Sorcery, Charming
and Inchantment? Wherein to free the guilty, and condemn
the innocent, is equally abominable to the Lord: And therefore
much judgment, caution, care and diligent inspection
ought to be used in the examining and determining of these
matters, wherein I have used as much perspicuity and plainness
as was possible to distinguish betwixt those that are Impostors,
Cheaters, and active Deceivers, and those that are but under
a mere passive delusion through ignorant and superstitious education,
a melancholy temper and constitution, or led by the vain
credulity of inefficacious Charms, Pictures, Ceremonies and the
like, traditionally taught them. The one sort of which deserves
to be punished for couzening of the people, and taking
upon them, and pretending to bring to pass things that they
have neither skill nor power to perform; but the other sort
rather merit pity and information, or the Physicians help than
any punishment at all. And I make bold to mind you of this
one thing especially that in things of this nature great heed
ought to be taken of the conditions, qualities, ends and intentions
of the Complainants and Informers, who are often
more worthy of punishment, than the persons accused. For many
forth of a meer deluded fancy, envious mind, ignorance and superstition
do attribute natural diseases, distempers, and accidents
to Witches and Witchcraft, when in truth there is no such matter
at all. And sometimes they counterfeit strange fits and
diseases, as vomiting of preternatural and strange things,
which if narrowly lookt into and examined are but Juglings,
and deceitful confederacies, and yet for malice, revenge or
some other base ends, do accuse others to be causers of them.</em></p>

<p class='c008'><em>And though you should find some confidently confessing that
they have made a visible and corporeal league with the Devil,
and that he hath carnal copulation with them, and that
he doth suck upon some parts of their Bodies, and that they are
Transubstantiated into Dogs, Cats, and the like, or that they
fly in the air, and raise Tempests; yet (I hope) I have sufficiently
proved by the word of God, the true grounds of Theologie
and sound reason, that there never hath been any
such ‘Witch’ existent <span class='blackletter'>in rerum natura</span>, and so you may know
what credit may be given to such Fables and impossibilities.</em></p>

<p class='c008'><em>So wishing that you may long live in Health and Happiness,
to do his Majesty and your Countrey service, which is,
and shall be my faithful prayer for you, I take leave subscribing
my self</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Knowing certainly that all writings once published, do equally
undergo one fate, as to stand or fall by the common
censures, judgments and opinions of Men; therefore
have I affixed, no Epithete, as foreseeing this Treatise (like
a Man once at Sea that is forced to hold out against all weathers)
must abide the censures of all sort of persons, how various
soever their minds and principles be. And though mens
fancies and opinions be commonly as different as their faces,
yet I shall enumerate some few general sorts, that may be sufficiently
comprehensive to comprise the most of other subordinate
particulars, and that in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. First, that which a Man hath found true by experience in
such like cases, may very reasonably induce him to expect the
like again; as after I had printed my book of the History of
Metals I met with some that were no more learned than Parrots,
who could not write true English, and whose greatest
skill was in the several ways of debauchery, and other poor
Pedanticks that were hardly masters of Grammar, and yet this
crew, and the like were rash and bold enough, to censure
my painful endeavours, and to scoff at it as a mere collection.
And therefore in publishing of this piece, which is a dark and
mysterious subject, I may very probably meet with some
troops of such rash ignorants, to whom only I shall return this
sharp, but suitable responsion. It is an ordinary thing for many
that never could shape a shoo, to reprove and find fault
with the Shoomaker: but such wise men (fit only for <em>Gotham</em>)
may learn these two Proverbs, <em>There is none so bold as blind</em>
Bayard, and <em>A Fools bolt is soon shot</em>, and their heads may be
fitter for Feathers, than the Laurel, and when any of them
have made such a collection as my former Book, or publisht
such a piece as this, then I shall give them a better answer,
and not before, <i><span lang="la">Lactucas non esse dandas hisce Afinis comedendas,
cum illis sufficiant cardui</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Prov. 26. 12.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. There are another generation that seem wise in their own
eyes, whose brains are like blown Bladders filled with the
wind of over-weening and self-conceitedness, and these usually
do huff, snuff, and puff at every thing that agrees not
with their Capricious Cockscombs, when their abilities for the
most part lie in the scraps they have gathered from the Theaters,
or from the discourses had in Taverns and Coffee-houses,
and if they can but reach some pittiful pieces of Drollery and
Raillery, they think themselves fit and able to censure any
thing though never read nor seen, except the Title Page. To
these I have little to say, as being but such airy and frothy Vaporoso’s,
as the least blast of sound reason maketh them vanish
into smoak and nothing; but only with them to take into
serious consideration, the saying of the Wiseman: <em>Seest thou
a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a Fool than
of him</em>. And the counsel of a learned Father is proper for such
vain confidents: <i><span lang="la">Expedit benè timere, quam malè fidere; &#38; utilius
est, ut infirmum se homo cognoscat, ut fortis existat, quàm fortis
videri velit, &#38; infirmus emergat</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. There are another sort that are so critically envious, that
they can allow of nothing that is not their own production,
and beareth not the test of their approbation, and cannot but
stigmatize the labours of others how good or beneficial soever
they be, because they shadow their fame, and tend not
to the advancement of their own reputation: even as divers
sorts of insects do feed upon the excrements of other animals,
so these feed their own humours, and please their own fancies
by the calumniating, and blacking the labours of others. These
being guilty of peevish morosity cannot look kindly at any
thing of anothers, without frowning, distast, and censuring;
but we have little to say unto such as these, but shall leave
them to the gall of their own breasts, and the spleen of their
own minds, having neither intended our labours for any such,
nor valuing their censures how sharp and bitter soever they be.
For <i><span lang="la">nulla fœlicitas tam magna est, ut malignitatis dentes vitare
possit</span></i>. And therefore it is discretion to bear that patiently for
which humane prudence can find no remedy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 13. 11.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. Others there are who are grown obstinate in their minds
and wills, concerning Spirits, Apparitions, Witchcraft, Sorcery,
Inchantment, and the like, and are grown pertinacious
and resolute to stick to and hold those opinions that they
have imbibed through ignorant education: not considering
that perseverance in a good cause, and well grounded opinion
is laudable and commendable, but pertinaciousness in a bad
and ill grounded tenent, is as bad and hurtful. And it is every
wise mans duty to study the cultivation and improvement
of the goods of the mind, and never to be ashamed to learn that
of which they were ignorant before. For the minds of men
are not only darkned in the fall of <em>Adam</em>, but also much misled,
by the sucking in of errors in their younger and more
unwary years, from whence they ought to endeavour with
might and main to extricate and deliver themselves. But he
that is wilfully setled upon the lees and dregs of former opinions,
though never so erroneous, hath shut forth all further
light from shining into his understanding, and so is become
wilfully blind. To such as these we shall only propose the example
and practice of the Apostle, who saith: <em>When I was a
child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a
child: But when I became a man, I put away childish things</em>. And I
advise them not to refuse the counsel of <em>S. Augustine</em>, who saith:
<i><span lang="la">Ad discendum quod opus est, nulla ætas sera videri potest: quia etsi
senes magis decet, docere quam discere; magis tamen decet discere,
quam ignorare</span></i>. And they need not be ashamed to imitate
<em>Socrates</em>, who did wax old every day learning something.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. As we have not intended this Treatise, and Introduction
for such conditioned persons as we have enumerated before,
so there are others to whom we freely offer and present it,
and shall shew the grounds and causes that moved us to undertake
such a mysterious, and dangerous subject. And those
are such as have an humble, lowly, and equal mind, that they
commonly read Books to be informed, and to learn those
truths of which they are ignorant, or to be confirmed in those
things they partly knew before. It is to such as these only
that we offer our labours, and therefore shall candidly declare
unto them the causes and reasons of our undertaking which
are these.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Though there be a numerous company of Authors that
have written of Magick, Witchcraft, Sorcery, Inchantment,
Spirits, and Apparitions, in sundry ages, of divers Countrys,
and in various languages: yet have they for the most but borrowed
one from another, or have transcribed what others had
written before them. So that thereby there hath been no right
progress made truly to discover the theory or ground of these
dark and abstruse matters, nor no precise care taken to instance
in matters of fact, that have been warrantably and sufficiently
attested: But only rhapsodies, and confused heaps of stories
and relations, shuffled together, when not one of an hundred
of them bore the face either of verity, or truth-likeliness,
whereby the understandings of Readers have remained
unenlightened, their memories confounded, and their brains
stuffed with Whimsies and Chimera’s. And though there be
nothing more common than disputes of Witches, and Witchcraft,
both in words and writing, yet not one of great multitudes
that hath plainly told us, in what notion, or under what
acceptation, they take the words, nor what description is agreed
upon, of either of these, that their existence, or not being,
their power and operations might be known and determined:
But all the disputes as yet concerning them have
been loose, wild, and <i><span lang="la">in vagum</span></i>. And therefore to remedie
this, as far as such a subject would allow, and our abilities
stretch, we were moved, and have attempted to clear those
difficulties. And if we do not (which is epidemical to mankind)
flatter and deceive ourselves, we have in some measure
reasonably attained, as having plainly laid down the notion
and acceptation of the words, Witches and Witchcraft, in
which we grant them an existence, and in what sense and respect
we grant them none, which is more (as we conceive)
than yet hath been performed by any. And though our instances
of matters of fact be neither, so punctual nor full as
might be wished, for things of this nature are deep and hid;
yet are they the best we could select or chuse; and this is one
chief reason why I undertook to treat of this subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Though the gross, absurd, impious and Popish opinions
of the too much magnified powers of Demons and
Witches, in this Nation, were pretty well quashed and silenced
by the writings of <em>Wierus</em>, <em>Tandler</em>, Mr. <em>Scot</em>, Mr. <em>Ady</em>,
Mr. <em>Wagstaff</em> and others; and by the grave proceedings of
many learned Judges, and other judicious Magistrates: yet
finding that of late two persons of great learning and note,
who are both (as I am informed) beneficed Ministers in the
Church, to wit Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>, and Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> have afresh
espoused so bad a cause, and taken the quarrel upon them;
And to that purpose have newly furbished up the old Weapons,
and raked up the old arguments, forth of the Popish
Sink and Dunghills, and put them into a new dress, that they
might appear with the greater luster, and so do with Tooth
and Nail labour to maintain the old rotten assertions, the
one in his Book called, A Treatise proving Spirits and
Witches <em>&#38;c.</em> the other in a Treatise called, A blow at modern
<em>Sadducism</em> &#38;c. Finding these (I say) as two new Champions
giving defiance to all that are of a contrary judgment,
I was stirred up to answer their supposed strong arguments,
and invincible instances, which I have done (I confess) without
fear, or any great regard to their Titles, Places, or Worldly
Dignities, but only considering the strength or weakness
of their arguments, proofs, and reason. For in this particular
that I have to deal, it is not with the men, but their opinions
and the grounds they would lay their foundations upon. And
if I be censured for dealing too sharply and harshly with them,
they must excuse me, for I profess I have no evil will at all against
their persons, no more than against a <i><span lang="la">non</span></i>-Entity, but
was justly zealous for the truth, and bitter against such opinions
as they have vented, which to me seem dangerous, and
in some respect impious, as (I suppose) I have fully proved.
And this was another reason of my writing about this subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Another reason that made me undertake this subject,
was the horrid absurdities the tenent of the common Witchmongers
brings along with it, as not only tending to advance
superstition and Popery, but also to be much derogatory to
the Wisdom, Justice, and Providence of the Almighty, and
to cry up the power of the Kingdom of darkness, to question
the verity of the principal Article of the Christian Faith,
concerning the Resurrection of Christ in his true numerical
Body, and generally to tend to the obstruction of the practice
of Godliness and Piety. These after I had seriously weighed
and considered them, did move me to labour as far as the
light of God’s word, the grounds of true Theology, and the
clear strength of reason would guide, and direct me, to undertake
the confutation of them as far as I was able, and if I have
failed I humbly desire those that are more able to handle the
matter more fully if possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>If any be moved that I seem to maintain some things that
are Paradoxes, I hope I may crave leave, as well to discede
from the opinions of others, as others have done from those
that went before them. And I desire them not so much to
consider, either the novelty or strangeness of the opinions, as
the weight and strength of the reasons that are laid down to
support and statuminate them; for if the arguments be sound
and valid, the Tenents built thereupon cannot be weak and
tottering. And however I acknowledge my self to have humane
frailties and so may err, yet I have no mind or will
pertinaciously to persevere in an error, and these things that
we have treated of lying so far from the ken of our senses, and
experiments of this nature, either so rare, or uncertain, that
we may rationally expect pardon, rather than reprehension.</p>

<p class='c008'>But I shall say no more, but let the Book speak for it self,
only desiring the Readers, first to peruse and seriously to
consider, before they censure, that so I may have cause to bid
them, Farewel.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Of the false, irrational, and unchristian Censures, that have
been, and yet are, cast upon Learned men, for writing of
abstruse Subjects: As also for treating of Apparitions and
Witchcraft, especially if they crossed the common stream
of vulgar Opinion.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Being about to treat of the mysterious and abstruse
Subject of Witches and Witchcraft, I cannot but think
it necessary (especially to make the things we handle
more plain and evidential) to imitate Architectors, who
when they intend to raise some fair Fabrick or Edifice,
do not only provide themselves of good and lasting Materials, but
above all take care to lay a firm and sure foundation, which they
cannot well accomplish, unless the earth and rubbish be removed,
that a firm ground for a foundation may be found out. So before
I lay the foundation of what I intend in this Discourse, I shall labour
to remove some censures and calumnies, that are usually cast
upon those learned persons that labour to unmanacle imprisoned
truth, and to adventure to cross the stream of vulgar Opinion,
backt with seeming Authority, Antiquity, or universality of Votes,
especially if they have intermeddled in Subjects occult and mysterious.</p>

<p class='c008'>And these Censures (how unjust soever) have often deterred the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>most able and best learned from divulging their opinions, or publish
their thoughts upon such difficult and intricate matters, which
(I conceive) ought not to be done for these reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. Because the best part of a man, as naturally considered, is his
Courage, Resolution, and Magnanimity, which should make him
resolute and couragious to declare and maintain, what he upon
sound and rational grounds apprehends to be truth, and not at all
to fear the censure or judgment of others, who may have had no
better means to inform themselves, or perhaps have been less diligent,
and however are subject to the same errours and mistakes of
Mankind, who must all confess the verity of that unerring Oracle,
<i><span lang="la">Humanum est errare</span></i>. And therefore he must needs be a person of
a poor, base, and low spirit, that doth conceal his own sentiments
of the truth, for fear of the censure or calumnies of others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>August. de Agone Christi.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. He that is afraid to declare his thoughts, for fear of censure
or scandal, must of necessity be very weak in his Morals, as having
little affection for verity, which is the chief object of the intellect,
and consequently ought above all things to sway and lead the affections.
And to be frighted from owning or declaring of the
truth, for fear of the vain, aery, groundless, and erroneous censures
of others, must needs speak a man weak in the grounds of Morality,
and to have small affection for vertue, whole guide is verity.
The Learned Father said exceeding well to this purpose: <i><span lang="la">Qui veritatem
occultat, &#38; qui prodit mendacium, uterq; reus est. Ille
quia prodesse non vult, ipse quia nocere desiderat.</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Gregor. Homil.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Chrysost. sup. Math.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. He that conceals the truth that he knows, for fear of the
censures of others, must needs have little of Christianity in him,
for we are commanded to buy the truth, and not to sell it;  but
for a Christian to conceal the truth, and not to dare to declare
and defend it, for fear of the vain and perishing censures of men, is
to make absolute sale of the truth, and that for the worst of all
prises that can be. For what a weightless and worthless prise are
the judgments and opinions of vain man, whose breath is in his nostrils,
and whose life is but a vapor, that a Christian should, for
fear of such vain censures, be afraid to declare or defend the truth?
Therefore let the subtil Politicians and <em>Machiavillians</em> of this Age,
who have in a manner turned the truth of the Christian Religion,
and the most certain Rules of Providence into Atheism, and becom’d
vain Idolaters, to sacrifice to the falsely adored and deified
fancies of their own craft and cunning, think or say what they
please, yet the rule of pious <em>Gregory</em> will ever hold true: <i><span lang="la">Ille veritatis
defensor esse debet, qui quum rectè sentit, loqui non metuit,
nec erubescit</span></i>. And that of <em>Chrysostom</em> ought never to be forgotten
by a good Christian, and one that fears God, who saith: <i><span lang="la">Non
solùm proditor est veritatis, qui mendacium pro veritate loquitur:
sed qui non liberè pronuntiat veritatem, quam pronuntiare oportet,
aut non liberè defendit veritatem, quam defendere oportet</span></i>. But as
there have been some that have been affrighted with the feigned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Bugbears of malevolent mens censures and scandals; so there have
been others, to whom Nature hath given greater Magnanimity,
who were better principled in their Morals, and better rudimented
in the Christian Religion, that have scorned and undervalued those
censures as vanities and trifles, and these were those</p>

<p class='c008'>1. In the first place we need not travel far, either in regard of
time or place, to find Precedents of such as have undergone no small
censures and subsannations for vindicating Truth, and labouring
the advancement of it, though against common and deep-rooted
Opinion. So ill entertainment new Inventors and Inventions have
always found amongst the present Masters of several Professions,
and those that made the World believe, that they alone had gained
the Monopoly of all Learning. Our learned Countryman Doctor
<em>Hackwell</em> in his Preface to his Apology, hath sufficiently proved
this particular: whose profound Piece of proving no decay in Nature
(a truth now sufficiently known, and assented to) found no
small opposition, both from the Learned in Theology, and other
persons, and underwent many sharp censures, until men had more
considerately weighed the strength and cogency of his Arguments,
which carry sufficient evidence to confute rational persons. Our
learned and most industrious Anatomist Dr. <em>Harvey</em>, who (notwithstanding
the late Cavils of some) first found forth and evidenced
to the World that rare and profitable discovery of the Circulation
of the Blood, did undergo the like Fate: who for eighteen or
twenty years together did groan under the heavy censure of all the
Galenists and expert Anatomists almost in <em>Europe</em>, and was railed
upon, and bitterly written against, not only by such as <em>Alexander
Rosse</em> and Dr. <em>Primrose</em>, but by <em>Riolanus</em> and others, and not forborn
by that famous Physician of <em>Roterodam</em>, <em>Zacharias Sylvius</em>,
who ingenuously confesseth thus much: <i><span lang="la">Primum mihi inventum
hoc non placuit, quod &#38; voce &#38; scripto publicè testatus sum; sed
dum postea ei resultando &#38; explodendo vehementiùs incumbo, refutor
&#38; ipse &#38; explodor: adeò sunt rationes ejus non persuadentes,
sed cogentes: diligenter omnes examinavi, &#38; in vivis aliquot
canibus eum in finem à me dissectis, verissimum comperi</span></i>. Which
was a most candid and free retractation and confession of his own
errours, and may be proposed as an example to all rash and unadvised
Censurers. Neither could this most clear and evidential Verity
(which falls under ocular Demonstration and manifest Experiments)
find countenance in the World, until that <em>Wallæus</em>, <em>Plempius</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and divers other judicious and accurate Anatomists, had
sound the truth of <em>Harvey</em>’s opinion, by their own tryals and ocular
inspection: so difficult it is to overthrow an old radicated opinion.
For I have known some years ago, that a person for owning or
maintaining the Circulation of the blood, should have been censured
and derided, as much by other Physicians, as one should be
now for denying the same: so hard it is to root out an opinion
(though never so false and groundless) if once setled in the brains of
many, and hath had a long current of continued reputation and belief.
And it is much more to consider the ignorance, stupidity,
and perversness of those, that in this Age of Knowledge dare take
upon them to censure (nay to condemn) that Society of persons,
and their endeavours, who have a just, pious, merciful, and learned
King for their Founder, and the greatest number of Nobility
and Gentry, renowned both for divine and humane Knowledge,
that can be chosen forth of the three Nations for their Members,
and whose undertakings and level are the most high, noble, and excellent
that ever yet the World was partaker of. And yet (which
may be wondred at) I have not only met with many, that do censure
and misjudge their vast and laudable enterprise, but even have
been bold to appear in Print to censure and scandalize their proceedings,
as is manifest in that Piece styled <em>Plus ultra</em>, written by
Mr. <em>Stubbs</em> of <em>Warwick</em>, wherein he hath effected as much as Dogs
do by barking at the Moon. But it is plain, that highness of place,
or greatness of parts exempts no man from evil tongues, or bad
censures. And to this purpose I cannot but add Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>,
who as he had a long sickness of body, so doubtless he wanted not
some distemper of mind, when in his Treatise of Credulity and
Incredulity, he uttered this. “If I may speak my mind (he saith)
without offence, this prodigious propensity to innovation in all
kinds, but in matters of Learning particularly, which so many
upon no ground, that I can see, or appearance of reason, are
possessed with; I know not what we should more probably ascribe
it unto, than to some sad Constellation or influence.” Alas!
poor man, he was so blind, that he could see no ground or appearance
of reason for the usefulness of Experimental Philosophy, nor
for the Institution of the Royal Society, but must ascribe it to the
Stars: it is a wonder why he ascribes it not to natural Melancholy,
as he doth almost all strange Effects, in his Book of Enthusiasm
or why not unto Demons or Witches, as he doth the most things
in the Treatise quoted.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. That learned and painful person <em>Renatus des Cartes</em>, who
brought in, revived, and refined the old Doctrine of Atoms, ascribed
to <em>Democritus</em>, and other of the Ancients, found for a long time
much opposition; insomuch that when he lived at <em>Utrecht</em> in <em>Holland</em>,
the Aristotelian Professors of that University became so inflamed
with envy at him, that their Scholars raised the Rabble of
the City at the sound of a Bell, to drive him out of Town. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>yet this mans Philosophy hath had the luck to triumph in that
University, where so much contempt was poured upon him; for
<em>Henricus Regius</em>, the publick Professor of Physick there, hath published
a Book of Natural Philosophy, agreeable to the Principles
and design of <em>Des Cartes</em>: and is in a manner generally received
and applauded; and by the honourable Mr. <em>Boyle</em> much made use
of, and by him styled the Corpuscularian Philosophy. So was not
that most learned and diligent Mathematician <em>Galalæus</em> imprisoned
for seeing more than others could by the help of his Optick Glasses,
losing (as one saith) his own liberty in Prison, for giving the Earth
liberty to fetch a round about the Sun? And yet now to what
great height of improvement are Telescopes arrived unto, and
what credit is given to the Observations made with them? though
in their birth their first Author and User so much opposed and punished;
for all Inventions that are new (as well as Opinions) are
in their beginnings opposed and censured, not considering, that all
acquired Knowledge, and all Arts and Sciences were once new, and
had their beginnings.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. When <em>Josephus Quercetanus</em> and Sir <em>Theodore Mayern</em> did labour
to introduce the practice of Chymical Physick into the City
of <em>Paris</em>, what cruel censures and scandals did they undergo by all
the rest of the Physicians of the Colledge, so that they were accounted
illiterate and ignorant Fellows and dangerous Empiricks,
not fit to practise in the King of <em>France</em> his Dominions, and so were
sentenced by the Colledge, and prohibited to practise? So far did
ignorance, self-interest, and blind malice prevail against these two
persons, of so much Worth and Learning, insomuch that the former
was made Physician to the King of <em>France</em>, and lived to see despised
Chymistry to flourish, where it had been most contemned, himself
to be honoured, and his Chymical Works to be published, and to be
had in great and general esteem with all that were Lovers of Learning.
The latter likewise out-lived the malice of all his enemies,
and saw himself advanced to be Physician to two potent and renowned
Kings of <em>England</em>, and to have the general practice of the
most of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, and to live to
a fair old age, and to dye vastly rich. So that even the bravest
men, for their noble endeavors for the good of Mankind, have always
found harsh usage.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. It hath fared no better with divers persons that have written
of abstruse and mysterious Subjects, such as were <em>Arnoldus de Villa
Nova</em> and <em>Raimundus Lullius</em>, who, because they handled that secret
and sublime Art of the Transmutation of Metals, were by the
ignorance and malice of <em>Francis Pegna</em> and the <em>John Tredeschen</em> of
<em>Rome</em>, <em>Athanasius Kircherus</em>, with some others, branded with the
name of Magicians, taken in the worst sense. <i><span lang="la">Facile est reprehendere
&#38; maledicere</span></i>, so apt are men through over-weening pride and
self-conceitedness, as though they were ignorant of nothing, to
take upon them to censure all things, when Artists only are fit to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>judge of those proper Arts, in which they are verst and bred in,
and not others: For it is not sufficient for a man to be verst in many
parts of Learning, but also in that very Science or Art, in which
the Question is propounded: as for Example; Suppose a man to be
well read in School Theology, Metaphysicks, Logick, Grammar,
Rhetorick, Ethicks, and Physicks, yet for all this how unable were
he to resolve one of the difficultest Propositions in <em>Euclid</em>? no
more can any person, though never so generally learned, if he perfectly
do not understand the method, terms, ground, matter, and
end of the Writers in mystical Chymistry, be any competent Judge
of their Art, nor of the nature of Transmutation. And this might
justly have bridled <em>Kircher</em>, and many other rash and vain Censurers
to hold back their judgment, until they perfectly understand
the matter, about which they are to give judgment, and to have
considered that Maxime of the wisest of men: <em>Seest thou a man wise
in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</em> But
notwithstanding these groundless slanders against <em>Arnoldus</em>, that
he was guilty of Diabolical Magick, from which the Pen of learned
<em>Nandæus</em> hath totally discharged him, though he otherwise (according
to his petulant humor and prejudiced opinion against the Art
of Transmutation, of which he was no competent Judge, for the
reason foregoing) cast some unworthy reflections both upon him,
and <em>Lully</em>, yet he confesseth (which is but the bare truth, as every
learned Physician doth sufficiently know, that have heedfully read
his Writings of the Art of Medicine) in these words, “That it is
certain, he was the learnedest Physician of his time, equally acquainted
with the Latine, Greek, and Arabian Tongues, and one
whose Writings sufficiently witness his abilities in the Mathematicks,
Medicine, and Philosophy, the practice whereof gained him
favour and imployment about Pope <em>Clement</em>, and <em>Frederick</em> King
of <em>Sicily</em>, who certainly would never have made use of him, if he
had thought him a Conjurer or Magician, such as many judged
he was.” As for <em>Lully</em> (notwithstanding the malevolent froth of
some rash, malicious, and ignorant Writers) he was guilty of no
other Magick but what was natural, lawful, and laudable, as his
profound and learned Works (if his blind Adversaries had ever
taken pains to have perused them, who frequently censure and condemn
those things they never saw, read, or understood) do witness
beyond all exception, and is all justified by the testimonies of so
many learned and judicious persons, that more cannot be said to
his praise and vindication. The most of his learned Works being kept
in the Library at <em>Oxford</em>, written in an ancient hand: which would
never have been done, if they had not been highly esteemed and prised.
For as <em>Zetznerus</em> the great Stationer of <em>Stasburgh</em> saith: “<i><span lang="la">Tantæ
suo fuisse ævo authoritatis atq; æstimationis legitur, ut justissimi
Arragonum Reges eum in privilegiis eidem concessis, magnum in
Philosophia magistrum, &#38; mirandarum artium &#38; scientiarum
authorem nominârint</span></i>.” Lastly, one Father <i><span lang="la">Pacificus</span></i> in his Journey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>from <em>Persia</em> 1628. came into the Isle of <em>Majorca</em>, where <em>Lully</em>
was born, and to his great admiration found the Statue of <em>Lully</em>
there in Wood curiously coloured, and he honoured as a Saint
(whom he had before judged an Heretick) as also a Society of Professors
following the Doctrine of <em>Lully</em>, and called <em>Raymundines</em>
or <em>Lullists</em>, and that they affirmed, that by Divine illumination he
had the perfect knowledge of Nature, by which he found out the
universal Medicine, by a certain <i><span lang="la">Aurum potabile</span></i>, by which he prolonged
his life to the 145. year of his age, in which year he suffered
Martyrdom. This I have produced to shew how inconsiderately
and ignorantly the best learned of an Age may be, and often
are wrongfully and falsely traduced and slandered, which may be
a warning to all persons to take heed how they pass their censures,
until they understand perfectly all that is necessary to be
known about the Subject they are to give judgment of, before
they utter or declare their sentence.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. <em>Roger Bacon</em> our Countryman, who was a <em>Franciscan</em> Fryar,
and Doctor of Divinity, the greatest Chymist, Astrologer, and Mathematician
of his time, yet could not escape the injurious and
unchristian censure of being a Conjurer, and so hard put to it, that
as <em>Pitts</em> saith, he was twice cited to <em>Rome</em> by <em>Clement</em> the Fourth,
to purge himself of that accusation, and was forced to send his Optical
and Mathematical Instruments to <em>Rome</em>, to satisfie the Pope and
the Conclave, which he amply performed, and came off with honor
and applause. To vindicate whom I need say little, because it is already
performed by the Pens of those learned persons, <em>Pitts</em>, <em>Leland</em>,
<em>Selden</em>, and <em>Nandæus</em>, only I shall add one Sentence forth of that
most learned Treatise, <i><span lang="la">De mirabili potestate artis &#38; naturæ, &#38; de
nullitate magiæ</span></i>. Where he saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Quicquid autem est præter
operationem naturæ vel artis, aut non est humanum, aut est fictum &#38;
fraudibus occupatum</span></i>. Another of our Country-men Dr. <em>John Dee</em>,
the greatest and ablest Philosopher, Mathematician, and Chymist
that his Age (or it may be ever since) produced, could not evade
the censure of the Monster-headed multitude, but even in his life
time was accounted a Conjurer, of which he most sadly (and not
without cause) complaineth in his most learned Preface to <em>Euclid</em>,
Englished by Mr. <em>Billingsley</em>, and there strongly apologizeth for
himself, with that zeal and fervency, that may satisfie any rational
Christian, that he was no such wicked person, as to have visible
and familiar converse (if any such thing can be nowadays) with
the Devil, the known Enemy of Mankind, of which take this short
passage, where he saith: “O my unkind Country-men, O unnatural
Country-men, O unthankful Country-men, O brain-sick, rash,
spiteful, and disdainful Country-men, why oppress you me thus
violently with your slandering of me contrary to verity, and
contrary to your own consciences?” Yet notwithstanding this,
and his known abilities in the most parts of abstruse Learning, the
great respect that he had from divers Princes, Nobles, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>most Learned in all <em>Europe</em>, could not protect him from this harsh
and unjust censure. For Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> near fifty years after Dr.
<em>Dees</em> death, hath in the year 1659. published a large Book in Folio
of <em>Dees</em> conversing for many years with Spirits (wicked ones he
meaneth.) But how Christian-like this was done, to wound the
mans reputation so many years after his death, and with that horrid
and wicked slander of having familiarity with Devils for many
years in his life time, which tends to the loss both of body and
soul, and to register him amongst the damned, how Christian-like
this is, I leave all Christians to judge? Besides, let all the World
judge in this case, that Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> being a sworn Witchmonger,
even to the credulity of the filthiest and most impossible of their
actions, cannot but allow of the Law that doth punish them for
digging up the bones of the dead, to use them to Superstition or
Sorcery; what may he then think the World may judge him guilty
of, for uncovering the Dormitories of the deceased, not to abuse
their bones, but to throw their Souls into the deepest pit of Hell?
A wickedness certainly beyond the greatest wickedness, that he
can believe is committed by Witches. It is manifest, that he hath
not published this meerly as a true relation of the matter of fact,
and so to leave it to others to judge of; but that designedly he
hath laboured to represent <em>Dee</em> as a most infamous and wicked person,
as may be plainly seen in the whole drift of his tedious Preface.
But his design to make <em>Dee</em> a Converser with evil Spirits
was not all, he had another that concerned himself more nearly.
He had before run in a manner (by labouring to make all that
which he called Enthusiasm, to be nothing else but imposture or
melancholy and depraved phantasie, arising from natural causes)
into the censure of being a Sadducee or Atheist. To wash off which
he thought nothing was so prevalent, as to leap into the other
end of the balance (the mean is hard to be kept) to weigh the
other down, by publishing some notorious Piece that might (as he
thought) in an high degree manifest the existence of Spirits good
and bad, and this he thought would effect it sufficiently, or at least
wipe off the former imputation that he had contracted.</p>

<p class='c008'>But that I may not be too tedious, I shall sum up briefly some
others, by which it may be made clear, that those dauntless Spirits
that have adventured to cross the current of common opinion, and
those that have handled abstruse Subjects, have never wanted opposition
and scandal, how true or profitable soever the things were
that they treated or writ of. <em>Trithemius</em> that Honour and Ornament
of <em>Germany</em> for all sorts of Literature, wanted not a <em>Bouillus</em>
to calumniate and condemn him of unlawful Magick, from which
all the Learned in <em>Europe</em> know he is absolved, by the able and elegant
Pen of him that styles himself <em>Gustavus Silenus</em>, and others.
<em>Cornelius Agrippa</em> run the same Fate, by the scribling of that ignorant
and envious Monk <em>Paulus Jovius</em>, from whose malicious slander
he is totally acquitted by the irrefragable evidence of <em>Wierus</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><em>Melchior Adams</em>, <em>Nandæus</em>, and others. Who almost have not read
or heard of the horrid and abominable false scandals laid upon
that <i><span lang="la">totius Germaniæ decus</span></i>, <em>Paracelsus</em>, by the malevolent Pen of
<em>Erastus</em>, and after swallowed up with greediness by <em>Libanius</em>, <em>Conringius</em>,
<em>Sennertus</em>, and many others? for not only labouring to
bring in a new Theory and Practice into the Art of Medicine, but
also for striving to purge and purifie the ancient, natural, laudable,
and lawful Magick from the filth and dregs of Imposture, Deceit,
Ceremonies, and Superstitions: yet hath not wanted most strong
and invincible Champions to defend him, as <em>Dorne</em>, <em>Petrus Severinus</em>,
<em>Smetius</em>, <em>Crollius</em>, <em>Bitiscius</em>, and many others. Our Countryman
Dr. <em>Fudd</em>, a man acquainted with all kinds of Learning, and
one of the most Christian Philosophers that ever writ, yet wanted
not those snarling Animals, such as <em>Marsennus</em>, <em>Lanovius</em>, <em>Foster</em>,
and <em>Gassendus</em>, as also our <em>Casaubon</em> (as mad as any) to accuse him
vainly and falsely of Diabolical Magick, from which the strength
of his own Pen and Arguments did discharge him without possibility
of replies. We shall now come to those that have treated of
Witchcraft, and strongly opposed and confuted the many wonderful
and incredible actions and power ascribed unto Witches: and
these crossing the vogue of the common opinion, have not wanted
their loads of unworthy and unchristian scandals cast upon them,
of which we shall only name these two, <em>Wierus</em> a learned person, a
German, and in his time Physician to the Duke of <em>Cleve</em>; the other
our Countryman Mr. <em>Reginald Scot</em>, a person of competent Learning,
pious, and of a good Family: what is said against them in
particular, I shall recite, and give a brief responsion unto it.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. There is a little Treatise in Latine titled <em>Dæmonologia</em>, fathered
upon King <em>James</em> (how truly we shall not dispute, for some
ascribe it to others) where in the Preface these two persons are intimated
to be Witches, and that they writ against the common opinion,
concerning the Power of Witches, the better to shelter and
conceal their Diabolical skill. But indeed this groundless accusation
needs no confutation, but rather scorn and derision, as having
no rational ground of probability at all, that they should be such
cursed Hypocrites, or dissembling Politicians, the one being a very
learned and able Physician, as both his Writings do witness, and
that upright and unpartial Author <em>Melchior Adams</em> in his life hath
most amply declared: the other known (as not living so very many
years ago) to be a godly, learned, and an upright man, as his
Book which he calleth, <em>The Discovery of Witchcraft</em>, doth most
largely make it appear, if his Adversaries had ever taken the pains
to peruse it. So that all rational persons may plainly see, that it is
but a lying invention, a malicious device, and a meer forged accusation.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. These persons are accused to have absolutely denied the existence
of Witches, which we shall demonstrate to be notoriously
false, by these following reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Considerat. about Witchcraft, p. 76.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>1. Could ever any rational man have thought or believed, that
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, a person who pretends to such high parts, would have
expressed so much weakness and impudence, as to have charged
Mr. <em>Scot</em> with the flat denial of the existence of Witches; as he
doth in these words speaking of him? and pretends this to be a
Confutation of the being of Witches and Apparitions; and this he
intimates in divers other places, but without any quotation, to
shew where or in what words <em>Scot</em> doth simply deny the Being of
Witches, which he doth no where maintain: so confident are many
to charge others with that which they neither hold nor write.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Mr. <em>Scot</em> and <em>Wierus</em> do not state the Question, <em>An sint</em>, Whether
there be Witches or not, but <i><span lang="la">Quomodo sint</span></i>, in what manner
they act. So that their Question is only, What kind of power supposed
Witches have, or do act by, and what the things are that
they do or can perform: so that the state of the question is not
simply of the Being of Witches, or <i><span lang="la">de existentia</span></i>, but only <i><span lang="la">de modo
existendi</span></i>: wherein it is plain, that every Dispute de modo existendi,
doth necessarily grant and suppose the certainty of the Existence,
otherwise the Dispute of the manner of their Being, Properties,
Power, or Acts would have no ground or foundation at all.
As if I and another should dispute about the extent, buildings, and
situation of the great City <em>Peking</em> in <em>China</em>, or about the length,
breadth, and height of the great Wall dividing <em>China</em> from <em>Tartary</em>;
we both do take for granted, that there is such a City, and such a
Wall, otherwise our Dispute would be wild, vain, and groundless:
like the two Wise-men of <em>Gotham</em>, who strove and argued about
the driving of sheep over a bridge; the one affirming he would
drive his sheep over the bridge, and the other protesting against it,
and so begun, one as it were to drive, and the other to stay and
stop them, when there were no sheep betwixt them. And this
might be a sufficient document to Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, to have been more
sober, than to have charged <em>Scot</em> so falsely. And do not the ancient
Fathers differ in their opinions <i><span lang="la">circa Angelorum modum existendi</span></i>,
some of them holding them to be corporeal, and some incorporeal?
yet both these parties did firmly hold their existence:
so that this is a false and improper charge, and hath no basis to
stand upon at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. What man of reason and judgment could have believed, that
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> or Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>, being persons that pretend to a great
share of Learning, and to be exact in their ways of arguing, would
have committed so pitiful and gross a fault, as is <i><span lang="la">fallacia consequentis</span></i>?
For if I deny that a Witch cannot flye in the air, nor
be transformed or transsubstantiated into a Cat, a Dog, or an Hare,
or that the Witch maketh any visible Covenant with the Devil, or
that he sucketh on their bodies, or that the Devil hath carnal Copulation
with them; I do not thereby deny either the Being of
Witches, nor other properties that they may have, for which they
may be so called: no more than if I deny that a Dog hath rugibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>(which is only proper to a Lion) doth it follow that I deny
the being of a Dog, or that he hath latrability? this is meer inconsequential,
and hath no connexion. So if I deny that a man cannot
flye by his natural abilities in the air like a Bird, nor live continually
in the Sea as a fish, nor in the earth as a Worm or Mole,
this doth not at all infer that I deny the existence of man, nor his
other properties of risibility, rationality, or the like. But this is
the learned Logick, and the clear ways of arguing that these men
use.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of Credul. and Incredul. p. 40.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. A third scandal Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> throws upon him is this, where
he saith thus: “For the Author doth little but tell odd tales and
silly Legends, which he confutes and laughs at, and pretends this
to be a confutation of the Being of Witches and Apparitions. In
all which, his reasonings are trifling and childish; and when he
ventures at Philosophy, he is little better than absurd. Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>,
though he confesseth he had never read <em>Scots</em> Book, but
as he had found it by chance in friends houses, or Book-sellers
Shops, yet doth rank him amongst the number of his illiterate
Wretches, and tells us how Dr. <em>Reynolds</em> did censure him and
some others.” To these, though they be not much material, we
shall give positive and convincing answers.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. There is no greater sign of the weakness of a mans cause, nor
his inability to defend it, than when he slips over the substance of
the question in hand, and begins to fall foul upon the adverse
party, to throw dirt and filth upon him, and to abuse and slander
him: this is a thing very usual, but exceeding base, and plainly
demonstrates the badness of their cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. If Mr. <em>Scot</em> hath done little but told odd tales and silly Legends,
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> might very well have born with him; for I
am sure his story of the Drummer, and his other of Witchcraft are
as odd and silly, as any can be told or read, and are as futilous,
incredible, ludicrous, and ridiculous as any can be. And if the
tales that <em>Scot</em> tells be odd and silly, they are the most of them taken
from those pitiful lying Witchmongers, such as <em>Delrio</em>, <em>Bodinus</em>,
<em>Springerus</em>, <em>Remigius</em>, and the like, the Authors that are most
esteemed with Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>, and other Witchmongers, of whom
we shall say more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. For Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> to give general accusations without particular
proofs, as to say <em>Scots</em> reasonings are trifling and childish, and
when he ventures at Philosophy, he is little better than absurd, do
plainly manifest the mans malice, and discover his weakness: For
<i><span lang="la">dolus versatur in universalibus</span></i>, and no man ought to be condemned
without particular and punctual proof, as to the time, place,
and all other circumstances, which Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> could not do, and
therefore he only gives general calumniations without ground; and
if <em>Scot</em> were little better than absurd, then he the better agrees
with Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, whose Platonical Whimseys are as absurd as any,
as we shall sufficiently prove hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>4. Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> must needs have been highly elevated with the
desire of censuring, when he would condemn a man without reading
his Book, or serious weighing the force of his arguments, this
concludes him of vast weakness, and of great perversness of mind,
as all rational men may judge; for in effect it is this, <em>Scot</em> is an illiterate
Wretch, and his Book full of errors, but I never read it, but
as I have looked upon it at a friends house, or a Book-sellers Shop:
is not this a wretched ground whereupon to build so wretched a
foundation, as thereby to judge him an illiterate Wretch? And to
censure him by the report of others, is as unjust, weak, and childish
as the former; and though Dr. <em>Reynolds</em> were a learned man, it
doth not appear for what particular point or errour he censured
Scot, and therefore is but a general and groundless charge, sheltred
under the colour of Dr. <em>Reynolds</em> reputation, an evidence, in Reason
and Law, of no weight or validity.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. For Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> to rank him amongst illiterate Wretches, is
against the very Rule of the Law of Nature, that teaches all men,
that they should not do that to another, which they would not
have another to do unto them. And sure Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> would not
have another to judge and condemn him for an illiterate Wretch,
and therefore, he ought not to have condemned Mr. <em>Scot</em> to be so.
And as it is against the Law of Nature, so it is contrary to the rules
of modesty and morality to give a man such stigmatizing titles:
nay it is even against the rules of good manners and civil education,
but that some men think that it is lawful for them to say any
thing, and that nothing what they say doth misbeseem them. And
lastly, how far it is against the Rules of Christianity and Piety, let
all good Christians judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The falsity of this foul scandal is manifest in both the particulars
therein couched. 1. For Mr. <em>Scot</em> was a learned and diligent
person, as the whole Treatise will bear witness; he understood the
Latine Tongue, and something of the Greek, and for the Hebrew,
if he knew nothing of it, yet he had procured very good helps, as
appeareth in his expounding the several words that are used in the
Scriptures for supposed Witches and Witchcraft; as also his quoting
of divers of the Fathers, the reformed Ministers, and many
other Authors besides, which sufficiently prove that he was not illiterate.
2. And that he was no wretched person, is apparent, being
a man of a good Family, a considerable Estate, a man of a very
commendable government, and a very godly and zealous Protestant,
as I have been informed by persons of worth and credit, and
is sufficiently proved by his Writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have not been thus tedious to accumulate these instances of
men that have been censured, for opposing vulgar opinions, or writing
of abstruse Subjects, as circumstantial only, or for a flourish,
but meerly as they are introductive, necessary, and pertinent to the
purpose I intend in this Treatise, as I shall make manifest in these
Rules or Observations following, and shall add sufficient reasons to
confirm the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Rule 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>1. That the generality of an opinion, or the numerousness of
the persons that hold and maintain it, are not a safe and warrantable
ground to receive it, or to adhere unto it: nor that it is safe or
rational to reject an opinion, because they are but few that do hold
it, or the number but small that maintain it. And this I shall labour
to make good by these sure and firm arguments following.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Exod. 13. 2.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Mat. 24. 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 6. 26.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Lib. de vit. beat. Lactant. Duimar. Instit. l. 2. c. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. Because the Scriptures tell us thus much: <em>Thou shalt not follow
the multitude to do evil.</em> And that there are many deceivers:
<em>For many shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive
many. And woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of
you: for so did their fathers to the false Prophets.</em> From whence
it is plain, that first we are to consider and be assured, that the
matter be not evil; for if it be, we are not at all to be swayed
with the multitudes that follow it, or that uphold it: so if the
opinion be evil, erroneous, or false, we ought not to receive
it, or adhere unto it, though never so many do hold or maintain
it. So that in truth and substance, we are not at all to consider,
whether there be few or many that hold it, but simply,
whether it be true or not. For as <em>Plato</em> tells us: <i><span lang="la">Neq; id considerandum
quid dixerit, sed utrum verè dicatur nec ne</span></i>.  For the multitude
have been by all good Authors and Learned men always
esteemed the most erroneous, as <em>Seneca</em> saith: <i><span lang="la">Quærendum non quod
vulgo placet, pessimo veritatis interpreti</span></i>. And <em>Lactantius</em> teaches
us this: <i><span lang="la">Vulgus indoctum pompis inanibus gaudet, animisq; puerilibus
spectat omnia, oblectatur frivolis, nec ponderare secum unamquamq;
rem potest</span></i>. And our Saviour gives us a proof and instance
of the errour of the multitude, and that in matter of fact. Did
not almost all the Jews under divers Kings Raigns applaud and
approve of the doctrine and opinions of the false Prophets, though
utterly erroneous? insomuch that <em>Elijah</em> said, that he only was left
of the true Prophets, though the false ones were many and numerous.
So that the Rule is proved to be true, both by the precept
and example of the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. If we consider the generality of Mankind, either in respect of
their inclinations and dispositions, or their breeding and education,
we shall not find one of an hundred, either by nature inclined, or
by education fitted and qualified to search forth and understand
the truth. And then if there be an hundred to one drowned in
ignorance and errors, and so few fitted to understand the truth of
things either divine or natural, then it must needs follow, that it is
not safe to embrace or adhere to an opinion, because of the great
number of those that hold or maintain it, but rather to stick to
the smaller number; though neither simply ought to be regarded,
but truth it self.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Again, if we consider those numbers, that either by nature
are inclined, or by education trained up in Learning, to enable
them to judge rightly betwixt truth and truth-likeliness, how few
of these that prove any thing excellent in those parts of Learning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>wherein they are bred, we may easily see the verity of this Rule
sufficiently proved, that it is not safe to embrace or adhere to an
opinion, because the numbers are great that hold or maintain it.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. If the multitude that hold the opinions, whether of spiritual
or natural things were to be followed, meerly because of the great
numbers that hold them: then if we look and consider the Writings
of the best Geographers, Travellers, and Navigators, we
should either be of the opinions of the Pagans, who are the most
numerous part of Mankind, or the Mahumetans, which are many in
respect of the paucity of Christians. And then what horrid, blasphemous,
idolatrous, impious, and diabolical opinions must we receive
and hold, both concerning God, Angels, the Creation, and
the most of the operations that are produced by Nature? So that
the arguments of Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> and Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, drawn from the
universality of the opinion, and the great multitudes of those that
hold it, are vain and groundless.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. If the comparison I use be thought too large, and the rule be
put only as to the greater part of the Learned that are in <em>Europe</em>, yet
it will hold good, that the greatest part of the Learned are not to
be adhered to, because of their numerousness; nor that the rest
are to be rejected, because of their paucity. For it is known sufficiently,
that a Bishop of <em>Mentz</em> was censured and excommunicated
for holding that there were <em>Antipodes</em>, by some hundreds of those
that were accounted learned and wise: so that it is plain, that the
greater number may be in the errour, and those that are few be in
the right. And did not the greatest number of the Physicians in
<em>Europe</em> altogether adhere to the Doctrine of <em>Galen</em>, though now in
<em>Germany</em>, <em>France</em>, <em>England</em>, and many other Nations the most have
exploded it? And was not the <em>Aristotelian</em> Philosophy embraced
by the greatest part of all the Learned in <em>Europe</em>? And have not
the <em>Cartesians</em> and others sufficiently now manifested the errours
and imperfections of it, and especially the endeavors of the honourable
and learned Members of the Royal Society here in <em>England</em>,
and the like Societies beyond Seas by their continual labour and
vigilancy about Experiments, made the errours and defects of it
obvious to all inquisitive persons? So that multitude, as multitude,
ought not to lead or sway us, but truth it self.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. If to all this we add, that truth in it self is but one; for <i><span lang="la">unum</span></i>
and verum are convertibles, and that errour or falsity is various and
manifold, and that there may be a thousand errours about one particular
thing, and yet but one truth; it will necessarily follow, the
greatest number holding an opinion, cannot be safe to be followed
because of their multitude, and the reason is errour, is manifold,
truth but one.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Rule 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. It is not safe nor rational to receive or adhere to an opinion
because of its Antiquity; nor to reject one because of its Novelty.
And this we shall make good from and by these following reasons.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Because there is no opinion (especially about created
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>things) but it hath once been new; and if an opinion should be
rejected meerly because of novelty, then it will follow, that either
all opinions might have been rejected for that very reason, or that
novelty is no safe ground only, why an opinion should be opposed
or rejected.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Antiquity and Novelty are but relations <i><span lang="la">quoad nostrum intellectum,
non quoad naturam</span></i>; for the truth, as it is fundamentally
in things <i><span lang="la">extra intellectum</span></i>, cannot be accounted either old or
new. And an opinion, when first found out and divulged, is as
much a truth then, as when the current of hundreds or thousands
of years have passed since its discovery. For it was no less a truth,
when in the infancy of Philosophy it was holden, that there was
generation and corruption in Nature, in respect of Individuals,
than it is now: so little doth Time, Antiquity, or Novelty alter,
change, confirm, or overthrow truth; for <i><span lang="la">veritas est temporis filia</span></i>,
in regard of its discovery to us or by us, who must draw it forth
<em>è puteo Democriti</em>. And the existence of the <em>West-Indies</em> was as
well before the discovery made by <em>Columbus</em> as since, and our ignorance
of it did not impeach the truth of its being, neither did the
novelty of its discovery make it less verity, nor the years since make
it more: so that we ought simply to examine, whether an opinion
be possible or impossible, probable or improbable, true or false;
and if it be false, we ought to reject it, though it seem never so
venerable by the white hairs of Antiquity; nor ought we to refuse
it, though it seem never so young, or near its birth. For as St. <em>Cyprian</em>
said: <i><span lang="la">Error vetustatis est vetustas erroris</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Advanc. of Learn. l. 1. c. 5.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. In regard of Natural Philosophy, and the knowledge of the
properties of created things, and the knowledge of them, we preposterously
reckon former Ages, and the men that lived in them,
the Ancients; which in regard of production and generation of the
Individuals of their own Species are so; but in respect of knowledge
and experience, this Age is to be accounted the most ancient.
For as the learned Lord <em>Bacon</em> saith: “Indeed to speak truly, <i><span lang="la">Antiquitas
seculi, juventus mundi</span></i>,” Antiquity of time is the youth of
the World. Certainly our times are the ancient times, when the
World is now ancient, and not those which we count ancient, <i><span lang="it">ordine
retrogrado</span></i>, by a computation backward from our own times;
and yet so much credit hath been given to old Authors, as to invest
them with the power of Dictators, that their words should stand,
rather than admit them as Consuls to give advice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Rule 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. It is not safe nor rational to resolve to stick to our old imbibed
opinions, nor wilfully to reject those that seem new, except
we be fully satisfied, from indubitable grounds, that what we account
old is certainly true, and what we reckon to be new is undoubtedly
false. And this will appear to be a truth, partly from
the weakness of their arguments, that seem utterly to condemn all
recession from ancient opinions, as vain, foolish, and unnecessary;
as also from other positive reasons.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>1. Some give the reason why they will not recede from an opinion
that their Predecessors held; for that their Forefathers were
as wise, if not wiser than they. But this, if strictly considered, is
very lame and defective; for their Predecessors were but men, and
so were liable both to active and passive deception, and were not
exempted from the common frailty of Mankind, who are all subject
to errours. And therefore, unless they were assured that their
Ancestors in former Ages, held the certain and undoubted grounds
of truth, it is nothing of reason in them, but meer perversness of
will, rather obstinately <i><span lang="la">errare cum patribus</span></i>, than to learn to follow
the truth with those that are coetaneous with them, which is foolish
and irrational. Further, there are more helps now, and means to
attain the knowledge of Verity, than were in the days when their
Ancestors lived, and it must be a kind of the greatest madness to
shut their eyes, that the light of truth may not appear unto them.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. This kind of reasoning hath no more of reason in it, than if
one should say, that because his Grandfather and great Grandfather
were blind or lame, therefore they will be so too: or that
their Ancestors never learned the Greek or Latine Tongues, nor to
write or read, neither will they learn any more than they did: or
that their Predecessors were ill husbands and unthrifts, and that
therefore they will continue the same courses: or that because their
Forefathers followed drunkenness and luxury, therefore they will
continue the same cariere of vices, as many of our debauched persons
do now adays, having no better reasons to alledge for their
exorbitant and vicious courses, but what the Prophet condemned,
<em>The fathers have eaten sowr grapes, and the childrens teeth are set
on edge</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. How far would they run back to state the beginning of their
Ancestors? If as far as their first Originals, then they must all be
Savages, Barbarians, and Heathens. And if they state it distant
from their first Originals, then their Predecessors had the same reason
to have continued, as those did that preceded them. But if
their Ancestors varied from, and left the steps and opinions of those
that went before them, then if they will do as their Ancestors did,
they must leave their courses and opinions, as they had done of
those that preceded them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>August. lib. de Liber. Arbitrio.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. Some say they cannot recede from the opinions of their Predecessors,
because it would be a shame and disgrace unto them. But
that which we call shame and disgrace consists in the opinion of
others, and we ought not to receive errour, or reject truth, by reason
of the censures or opinions of others: <i><span lang="la">Si de veritate scandalum
sumitur, utilius permittitur nasci scandalum, quàm veritas relinquatur</span></i>.
And to leave an errour to entertain truth, is so far from
being a shame and a disgrace, that there cannot be a greater honour
or glory: for <i><span lang="la">errare humanum est, sed in errore perseverare belluinum
ac diabolicum est</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Rule 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. Those effects that seem strange and wonderful, either in respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of Art or Nature, require much diligence truly to discover and
find out their causes; and we ought not rashly to attribute those
effects to the Devil, whose causes are latent or unknown unto us:
and that for these grounds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Inject. mater. pag. 597.</span></i></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid. pag. 598.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. It hath been common almost in all Ages, not only for the vulgar,
but also for the whole rabble of Demonographers and Witchmongers
to ascribe those strange and wonderful effects, whether
arising from Art or Nature, unto the worst of Gods Creatures, if
they did not themselves understand their causes, and to censure the
Authors that writ of them, as Conjurers and Magicians, as I have
made manifest in my former Instances, and might be further made
good and illustrated by the effects of healing by the Weapon-salve,
the Sympathetick Powder, the Curing of divers Diseases by Appensions,
Amulets, or by Transplantation, and many other most admirable
effects both of Art and Nature, which by these self-conceited
Ignorants are all thrown upon the Devils back, and he made
the Author and effector of them, as though he had a kind of omnipotent
power: of which the learned Philosopher and Physician
<em>Van Helmont</em> gives us this account: “<i><span lang="la">Credo equidem cum pietate
pugnare, si Diabolo tribuatur potestas naturam superans. Verum
naturæ ignari præsumunt se naturæ secretarios per librorum lectionem:
quicquid autem ipsos latet, vel adynaton, vel falsum, vel
præstigiosum, atq; diabolicum esto.</span></i>” And a little after he adds
this: “<i><span lang="la">Pigritiæ saltem enim immensæ inventum fuit, omnia in
Diabolum retulisse quæ non capimus, nec velim Diabolum invocatum,
ut nostris satisfaciat quæstionibus per temerariam potestatum
attributionem.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Whosoever shall read <i><span lang="la">Pancirollus de rebus memoralibus noviter
repertis</span></i>, may easily be satisfied, what strange and stupendious
things Art and the Inventions of men have produced in these latter
Ages. And no man can rationally doubt, but that many more
as strange or far more wonderful, may in Ages to come be found
out and discovered; for there is a kind of bottomless depth in
Arts, whether Liberal or Mechanical, that yet hath not been founded,
but lye hid and unknown unto men. And if these for their
wonderfulness should (as former Ages have ignorantly done) be
ascribed unto the power of Satan, and their Authors accused of
Conjuring and Diabolical Magick, no greater wrong could be
done unto Art and Artists, and it would be a kind of blasphemy
to attribute these stupendious effects (as the Vulgar and Witchmongers
use to do) unto the Devil, the worst of Gods Creatures,
and the Enemy of Mankind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Pag. 103.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 1. 20.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Civit. Dei lib. 10.</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>3. The third argument I shall take from Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> (which is
the greatest piece of truth in all his Treatise) and convert and retort
it against him: and is this (he saith) <em>We are ignorant of the
extent and bounds of Natures Sphere and Possibilities.</em> Now if
we be ignorant of the extent and bounds of Natures Sphere and
Possibilities, then it must needs be folly, madness, and derogative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>against Gods power in Nature, to attribute those effects to wicked,
fallen, and degenerated Demons, that we do not know but are
produced by the course of Nature. And to ascribe the products
of Nature to such wicked Instruments is blasphemous, in depriving
Nature of the honour due unto her, and robbing God of the honour
and glory belonging unto him, for the wonderful power
wherewith he hath endowed his Creatures, who were all made to
shew forth his power and Godhead, <em>and the Heavens declare the
glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth his handy-work</em>: and as
one said very well, <i><span lang="la">Natura creatrix est quædam vis &#38; potentia divinitùs
insita, alia ex aliis in suo genere producens</span></i>. So that the
honour that is due unto the Creator, Conserver, and Orderer of
Nature ought not to be ascribed unto the Devils; for in doing this,
the Witchmongers become guilty of Idolatry, and are themselves
such Witches as are mentioned in the Old Testament, who by their
lying Divinations led the people after them to follow Idols; therefore
the effects that belong unto Nature, are to be attributed to
Nature, and the effects that Devils produce, are to be ascribed unto
them, and not one confounded with another. And much to
this purpose the learned Father hath a very considerable passage:
“<i><span lang="la">Quicquid igitur mirabile fit in hoc mundo, profectò minus est quàm
totus hic mundus, i. e. cœlum &#38; terra, &#38; omnia quæ in eis
sunt, quæ certè Deus fecit: nam &#38; omni miraculo quod fit per hominem,
majus miraculum est homo. Quamvis igitur miracula visibilium
naturarum videndi assiduitate vilescunt, tamen ea quum
sapienter intuemur, inusitatissimis rarísq; majora sunt.</span></i>”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Job 1. 11. &#38; 2. 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Pet. 2. 4.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>August. super Psal.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. Though these men should believe the power of the Devil to
be great by his Creation, and not lessened by his Fall (which is
doubtful or false) yet can he not exert, or put this power into
execution, but when, where, as oft, and in what manner, as God
doth send, order, direct, and command him: and could not enter
into the herd of Swine, until that Christ had ordered and commanded
him; nor to touch <em>Job</em> or afflict him either in his goods
or body, until that God had given him licence and order with express
limitation how far he should proceed, and no further. In
all which there appeareth nothing at all of his power, but his malice
and evil will; and what was effected, was the hand of the Lord,
and he but the bare Instrument to execute and perform the command.
Therefore to ascribe to the Devil the efficiency of those
operations we do not clearly understand, is to allow him a kind
of Omnipotency, and both to rob God and Nature of that which
belongeth unto them; for the Almighty doth work whatsoever
he pleases both in Heaven and Earth, and it is he that worketh all
in all. And the Devil is but as Gods Executioner to fulfil his will
in tempting men, and punishing the wicked, and can act nothing
but as God commands him, except the acts of his wicked and depraved
will; for he is with all his Angels delivered into chains of
darkness to be reserved unto Judgment. To this purpose there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>a very true and Christian saying of St. <em>Augustine</em> in these words:
“<i><span lang="la">Diabolus plerumq; vult nocere, &#38; non potest, quia potestas ista est
sub potestate: nam si tantum posset nocere Diabolus quantum vult,
aliquis justorum non remaneret.</span></i>”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Rule 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. The last Rule I shall observe is, That men, if they mean to
profit by reading Controversies of this nature, they must prudently
and deliberately consider the design that Authors have had in
writing. For though it be the general pretence of all, that they
write to confute errours, and to maintain truth, yet very few in
Disputes of this nature have sincerely performed this pretended
end. For some have written (as we shall hereafter make manifest
in due place) upon designed purpose, thereby to establish some
points in their corrupted and superstitious Religion. Some because
of their own lucre and profit arising by the upholding of these opinions
of the great power and performances of Witches, as did all
the Inquisitors and their Adherents, having a share in the condemned
Witches goods. Others have written in these Subjects meerly
for ostentation and vain-glory, to get a name that they were learned
and able persons: of all which the judicious Readers ought to
beware of, and to consider. There is another main scandal that
Witchmongers usually (especially of late) cast upon those that oppose
their gross, impious, and blasphemous opinions; but I cannot
seasonably give answer unto it, untill I have laid down the
state of the question, upon which the substance of this Treatise is
grounded, and therefore shall proceed to its Explication.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAP. II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'><em>Of the Notion, Conception, and Description of Witches and
Witchcraft, according to divers Authors, and in what
sense they may be granted, and in what sense and respect
they are denied.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Those that are Masters in Ethicks teach us, that every Vertue
hath on either side one Vice in the extreme, and that Vertue
only consists in the mean, which how hard that mean is to be kept
in any thing, the Writings and Actions of the most Men do sufficiently
inform us. This is manifest, that not many years ago the
truth of Philosophy lay inchained in the Prisons of the Schools, who
thought there was no proficiency to be made therein, but only in
their Logical and Systematical ways: so that (in a manner) all liberty
was taken away both in writing and speaking, and nothing
was to be allowed of that had not the Seal of Academick Sanction.
And now when Philosophy hath gotten its freedom, to expatiate
through the whole Sphere of Nature, by all sorts of inquiries and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>tryals, to compleat a perfect History of Nature, some are on the
other hand grown so rigid and peremptory, that they will condemn
all things that have not past the test of Experiment, or conduce
not directly to that very point, and so would totally demolish
that part of Academick and Formal Learning that teacheth
men Method and the way of Logical procedure in writing of Controversies,
and handling of Disputes. Whereas what is more necessary
and commendable for those that treat of any controverted point
in Writing or in other Disputations, than a clear and perspicuous
Method, a right and exact stating of the Question in doubt, defining
or describing the terms that are or may be equivocal, and
dividing the whole into its due and genuine parts, distinguishing
of things one from another, limiting things that are too general,
and explaining of every thing that is doubtful? Those that would
totally take away this so profitable and excellent a part of Learning,
are not of my judgment, nor can be excused for having run into
that extreme that is extremely condemnable. Let Experimental
Philosophy have its place and due honour; and let also the Logical,
Methodical, and Formal ways of the Academies have its due praise
and commendation, as being both exceedingly profitable, though
in different respects; otherwise, in writing and arguing, nothing but
disorder and confusion will bear sway.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have premised thus much, because the most of the Authors that
have treated about this knotty and thorny Subject of Witches and
Witchcraft, have been as confused and immethodical as any. For
whereas the learned Orator <em>Cicero</em> tells us, that <i><span lang="la">omnis discursus à
definitione debet proficisci</span></i>; and that it is also true, that what is not
aptly and fitly defined or described, as far as the Subject will admit
of, is never perfectly understood: yet have the most of these Authors
(which are numerous) laid down no perfect description of a
Witch or Witchcraft, nor explained fully what they meant by that
name, notion, or conception. And therefore, lest I become guilty
of the same fault, I shall lay down what the most considerable Authors
that have treated of this Subject, do mean or intend by this
word <em>Witch</em>, and <em>Witchcraft</em>, and shall fully explain in what notion
or sense I either allow or deny them, and their actions, and that in
this order, and in these Particulars following.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Lib. 14. method. c. 9.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid. c. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. Though an argument taken <i><span lang="la">à denotatione nominis</span></i> be of little
weight or validity, and that the industrious and sharp-witted
person <em>Galen</em> doth seem to make little account of words, that is, in
this respect, when we would only understand the nature of things,
yet in another respect he concludeth thus: “<i><span lang="la">Verùm qui alterum
docere volet quæ ipse tenet, huic prorsus nominibus propter res uti
est opus.</span></i>” Now the handling of Controversies is chiefly and principally
to inform others, and teach them the truth, and to discover
errours; therefore in this respect the explication and denotation of
words is exceeding profitable and necessary: and so <em>Plato in Cratylo</em>
tells us: “<i><span lang="la">Nomen itaq; rerum, substantiam docendi discernendiq;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>instrumentum est.</span></i>” And it being a manifest truth, that words
are but the making forth of those notions that we have of things,
and ought to be subjected to things, and not things to words: if
our notions do not agree with the things themselves, then we have
received false <em>Idola</em> or images of them; but if we have conceived
them aright, and do not express them fitly and congruously, then
we shall hardly make others understand us aright, nor can clearly
open unto them the doctrine that we would teach them.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. But to come to the signification and acceptation of the words
that those Authors, who have magnified and defended the power
of Witches, have used to express their notions by, we shall find
them to be so far fetcht, so metaphorical, and improperly applied,
that no rational or understanding man can tell us what to make of
them. And if we take the notion, as they do, of a killing and murthering
Witch, with the rest of the adjuncts, which they couple
with it, we shall not be able to find a proper and significative
word, either in the Hebrew, Greek, Latine, French, Spanish, Italian,
or High-Dutch, but a multitude or a <em>Ferrago</em> of words, whereof
not one doth properly signifie any such thing, as they would make
us believe, by the notion that they maintain of a Witch: of which
we shall principally note these.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lament. 4. 3.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. For the Hebrew words used in the Old Testament we shall
not mention them here, but afterward, where we speak of the mistranslation
of them, and therefore shall pursue them in the Latine,
and other Languages. And first they sometimes use the word <em>Lamia</em>
in the Latine, <span lang="grc">Λάμια</span> in Greek, which <em>Gesner</em> and others tell us
doth signifie a terrestrial Creature, or a voracious fish, as also a Spectrum
or Phantasm. And this was supposed to be a Creature with
a face like a Woman, and feet like a Horse or an Ass, such as (indeed)
neither is, nor ever was <i><span lang="la">in rerum natura</span></i>, but was only a figment
devised to affright children withal. But if we will believe
Poetical Fables, the Romances of <em>Philostratus</em> concerning <em>Apollonius</em>,
or the lying Diary of his Man <em>Damis</em>, we must take it to be a
Spirit or Apparition, such as the Greeks called <em>Empusæ</em>, that went
upon one leg, and had eyes that they could take forth, and set in,
when they pleased. And such a monstrous Fable and Lye was a
sufficient ground for doting Witchmongers to build their incredible
stories of the power and actions of Witches upon, having no
proper word for such a Witch as they falsely believe and suppose.
Though there be a Text in the Lamentations of <em>Jeremiah</em>, that
hath given occasion or colour to this vain opinion, especially as the
vulgar Latine renders it, which is thus: <i><span lang="la">Sed &#38; Lamiæ nudaverunt
mammam, lactaverunt catulos suos. Filia populi mei crudelis, quasi
struthio in deserto.</span></i> The French render it, <em>The Dragons have made
bare their breasts</em>: and so have also the Italians in their Translation
retained the words Dragon and Ostrich; and also the Septuagint
render the words <span lang="grc">δράχοντες</span> and <span lang="grc">στρουθίον</span>. And <em>Luther</em> in his Translation
hath kept the same words, though the Germans call <span class='blackletter'><span lang="de">Lamia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Ein Rachtsgeist</span></span>. But our own Translation hath come more near
the truth: <em>Even the Sea-monsters draw out the breast, they give suck
to their young ones: the Daughter of my people are become cruel like
the Ostriches in the wilderness.</em> And <em>Arias Montanus</em> gives it thus:
<em><span lang="la">Etiam draco——<span lang='he' dir='rtl'>תנין</span> Tannin</span></em> (which signifieth a Dragon, Serpent,
Whale, or other Sea-creatures) <i><span lang="la">solverunt mammam, lactaverunt
catulos suos: Filia populi mei in crudelem, veluti ululæ in deserto.</span></i>
But none hath come up close to the mark but <em>Junius</em> and <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>,
who render the place thus: <i><span lang="la">Etiam Phocæ præbent mammam, lactant
catulos suos, quomodo filia populi mei, propter crudelem inimicum, est
similis ululis in deserto.</span></i> And the Notes upon the place do make
it plain: “<i><span lang="la">Vox quidem Hebræa latè patet, significans serpentes &#38;
reptilia magna, sive terrestria sive aquatilia; sed cùm non omnium
reptilium sint mammæ, neq; aquaticorum sint ii quos Propheta vocat
catulos; necesse fuit hunc locum ad Phocas, id est marinos vitulos
accommodari, qui à natura sint quasi Amphibii. Nam Draconibus
accommodari non potest, cùm volucrium solus vespertilio
mammas habeat: serpentium terrestrium nulla species mammata est,
ac proinde hæc ad marinum istud genus referri debent.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Another far fetcht and improperly applied name to Witches,
is <em>Strix</em>, and so some Authors call them <em>Striges</em>; when as the word
<em>Strix</em> doth properly signifie a nocturnal bird, <i><span lang="la">à stridendo sic dicta</span></i>,
that do use to suck the dugs of Goats, and also of young children,
which we shall shew hereafter to be a Truth, and no Fable, as <em>Ovid</em>
saith,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>This is that sort of bird that <em>Gesner</em> calleth <em>Caprimulgus</em>, and the
Greeks <span lang="grc">Ἀιγαθήλας</span>, the Germans <span class='blackletter'>Rachtvogel</span> or <span class='blackletter'>Rachtraven</span>, the
Hebrews <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>לילית</span> <em>Lillith</em>, as is said in <i><span lang="la">Isaiah: Quin &#38; ibi subitò quievit
strix (seu lamia) &#38; invenit sibi requiem.</span></i> It is taken to be a kind
of Owl, little bigger than an Ousel, and less than a Cuckow, they
are blind upon the day, and flye abroad upon the nights, making
an horrible noise, and were to be found about <em>Rome</em>, <em>Helvetia</em>, and
<em>Crete</em> or <em>Candy</em>, and do certainly suck the dugs of Goats, that thereby
they waste away and become blind. And that they are also
sometimes found in <em>Denmark</em>, that learned Physician and laborious
Anatomist <em>Bartholinus</em> doth make manifest, and that they do suck
the breasts or navils of young children. Now what affinity hath
this to a Witch or Witchcraft? but that Witchmongers would
bring in any allusion or Metaphor, though never so impertinent or
incongruous? For if it were transferred to the actions of Witches,
yet as <em>Calepine</em> tells us: <i><span lang="la">Ab hujus avis nocumento striges appellamus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>mulieres puellulos fascinantes suo contactu, &#38; lactis mammarúmq;
oblatione</span></i>. So that if the assimulation were proper in any proportion
or particular, those Women they do account Witches, do but
hurt the little children with the virulent steams of their breath, and
the effluviums that issue from their filthy and polluted bodies, and
so wrought by contact and contrectation, by which the contagious
poyson is conveyed, but not by Witchcraft.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Act. 1. 26.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Prov. 16. 33.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. There is another word that they apply to Witches, as insignificant
and improper as the other, and that is <em>Sortilegus</em>, <span lang="grc">χρησμολόγος</span>,<a id='t23'></a>
a Teller of Fortunes by Lots or Cuts: and <em>Lambertus Danæus</em>, who
in other things was a judicious and learned person, yet doted extremely
about this opinion, calling a Witch <em>Sortiarius</em>, deriving it
from <em>Sortilegus</em>, which the French call <em>Sorcier</em>. Now what affinity
or congruity hath casting or using of Lots with that which these
men call <em>Witchcraft</em>? surely none at all. For though Lots may,
like the best things, be abused and wrested to a vain or evil end,
yet are they not altogether evil, but that a civil and lawful use may
be made of them, as is manifest this day at the famous City of <em>Venice</em>,
where their chief Officers are chosen by them. And also there
hath been a godly and divine use made of them even by the Apostles
themselves, in the deciding of the Election of <em>Barsabas</em> and
<em>Matthias</em>, upon the latter of which the Lot fell, and so he was
numbred with the eleven Apostles. And <em>Solomon</em> tells us, <em>The lot
is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord</em>.
And sure these men were at a loss to find a suitable word to fix
upon these Creatures, to whom they ascribe such impossible and
incredible actions, when they were fain to bring this appellation of
<em>Sortilegus</em>, that hath no kinship at all with such Witches, as they
mean and intend.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Sometimes they call them by the name <em>Saga</em>, which signifieth
no more than a Wife and subtil Woman, being derived <i><span lang="la">à sagiendo</span></i>
to perceive quickly, or to smell a thing quickly forth, which the
Germans call <span class='blackletter'>Vnhold</span>, which is no more than <em>malevolus</em>, or evil-willed.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. They use the word <i><span lang="la">Veneficus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">venefica</span></i>, and <i><span lang="la">veneficium</span></i>, and this
in its proper signification and derivation from the Latine, doth
import no more than a Poysoner, or to make poyson, <i><span lang="la">venenum facere</span></i>,
and so might perhaps be given unto them, because by Tradition
they had learned several ways to poyson secretly and strangely,
as doubtless there may be divers hidden and not ordinarily
known ways (as we shall shew hereafter) by which either by smelling,
tasting, touching (and it may be by sight) they could kill
and destroy, though the means they used, and the effects produced,
were meerly natural; yet because the manner was very occult
and unperceivable, it was through ignorance and want of due inspection
into the matters accounted Diabolical; when there was
no more of a Devil in the business, than is in a Thief or Murtherer,
but only in the Use and Application, which is to steal, kill, or destroy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>And this, though now improperly and abusively called
Witchcraft, doth but signifie poysoning, and so the French call it
<i><span lang="fr">Empoisonnement</span></i>, and the Italians <em>Veneficio</em> or <em>Avenenatione</em>, and
the Germans <span class='blackletter'><span lang="de">Vergifftung</span></span>, which all amount to one purpose. And
this <i><span lang="la">Veneficium</span></i> or poysoning the Greeks call <span lang="grc">Φαρμάκευσις</span> and <span lang="grc">Φαρμακία</span>
from <span lang="grc">Φάρμακον</span> <i><span lang="la">Medicamentum v.l. Venenum</span></i>; for sometimes it was
taken in the better sense for a curing and healing Medicine; and
sometimes in the worse for poyson that did kill or destroy. Neither
can it be found in any Greek Author to signifie any more, than
such men or women that used Charms and Incantations, and were
believed by the Vulgar to effect strange things by them, when in
truth and indeed they effected nothing at all but by natural means
and secret poysons, and from thence had these names. And the
Poets spoke of them to adorn and imbellish their Poems withal,
according to common opinion; not that either they themselves believed
the things to be so done, as the Vulgar believed, nor to give
credit to such false Fables and impossibilities; but to make their
Poems more delectable and welcome to the common people, who
are usually taken with such fond Romantick stories and lyes. But
after the year 1300. when the Spanish Inquisitors, the Popish Doctors
and Writers had found the sweetness and benefit of the confiscated
Goods of those that they had caused to be accused and condemned
for Witches, in their sense then these words either in the
Greek or Latine were wrested to signifie a Witch that made a visible
and corporeal League with the Devil, when in the true sense of them
they did but signifie a secret Poysoner. So that all things were
hurried, though never so improper and dissonant, to be made serviceable
to their filthy lucre and avaritious self-endedness. <i><span lang="la">Templum
venale Deúsq;</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Lastly, For Witchcraft they used the Latine <em>Fascinum</em> and
<em>Fascinatio</em>, and so they called a Witch <em>Fascinator</em> and <em>Fascinatrix</em>,
and this the Greeks called <span lang="grc">Βασκανίον, Βασκανία</span>, <em>Fascinum</em>, <em>Fascinatio</em>,
also <i><span lang="la">invidia, odium, seu invidentia</span></i>, <span lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ Βασκανεῖν</span>, <i><span lang="la">à fascinando,
seu oculis occidendo</span></i>: the Germans call it <span class='blackletter'><span lang="de">Zaubery</span></span>, and <span class='blackletter'><span lang="de">Verzauberung</span></span>,
and sometimes <span class='blackletter'><span lang="de">Hexenwerk</span></span>;<a id='t24'></a> the French <i><span lang="fr">Ensorcellement</span></i>
and <em>Sorcelerie</em>; the Italians <i><span lang="it">Lestrigare &#38; amaliare</span></i>, <i><span lang="it">amaliamento</span></i>;
the Belgicks <span class='blackletter'>Betoovenge</span>: the Saxons called them and it <span lang="ang">Ƿɩcce</span> and
<span lang="ang">Ƿɩcce-cꞃeeꝼꞇ</span>, from whence we have the name Witch and Witchcraft,
that signified <em>Saga</em>, <i><span lang="la">Venefica</span></i>, <em>Lamia</em>, and <em>Fascinum</em>, <em>Magia</em>, <i><span lang="la">Incantatio</span></i>,
<em>Fascinatio</em>, <i><span lang="la">Præstigium</span></i>: of which (because we shall have
occasion to speak more of it hereafter) we shall here only note
these few things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Alexand. Aphrod. lib. 2. Probl. 53.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. It is taken sometimes for Envy and Malice, because those that
were supposed to use Fascination, did direct it to one Creature
more than another through their envious minds, as may be perceived
by some few Authors: And so was accounted a kind of eye-biting
whereby (as the Vulgar believed) children did wax lean,
and pined away, the original whereof they referred to the crooked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and wry looks of malicious persons, never examining the truth of
the matter of fact, whether those children that pined away, had
any natural disease or not, that caused that macilency or pining
away; nor considered, whether or no there was any efficiency in
the envy or wry looks of those malicious persons, but vainly ascribed
effects to those things that had in them no causality at all to
produce such effects.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Eclog. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Sometimes this kind of Fascination was ascribed to the sore
or infected eyes of those that were accounted causers of hurt thereby
in others, and in this sense <em>Virgil</em> saith: <i><span lang="la">Nescio quis teneros oculus
mihi fascinat agnos</span></i>. And by this no more could be understood,
but that those that had infected and sore eyes might infect
others, and this was nothing but contagion, or corrupt steams issuing
from one body to another, which may happen in many diseases,
as is manifest by the Writings of divers learned Physicians, as in bodies
infected with the Plague, French Pox, Leprosie, Ophthalmies,
and such like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Sup. Epist. D. Paul. ad Galat.</em> <em>c.</em> 3.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. Sometimes Fascination is taken for some kind of Incantation,
that by virtue of Words or Charms doth perform some strange
things; but concerning this there is such incertainty of the opinions
of the Learned, some flatly denying that Words or Charms have
in them any natural efficacy at all; others as strongly affirming it,
that of this point it is very difficult to make a clear determination:
and therefore we shall say but this of it here, that the Angelical
Doctor did conclude well in this particular, in these words: “<i><span lang="la">Ad
sciendum autem quid sit fascinatio, sciendum est quòd secundùm
glossam fascinatio propriè dicitur ludificatio sensus, quæ per artes
magicas fieri consuevit, puta, cum hominem facit aspectibus aliorum
apparere leonem, vel cornutum, &#38; hujusmodi</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Having been thus large in considering the names and denomination
given to those persons that are esteemed Witches, and finding
them to be so improper, impertinent, various, and uncertain, let
us now proceed to the notion and acceptation of Witchcraft and
Witches, to try if in that we can find any more certainty or consonancy,
and herein we shall produce some of the chief descriptions
that are given of them by several Authors; for to quote all would
be tedious and superfluous. Those that are or may be accounted
Witches we rank in these two orders.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Those that were and are active deceivers, and are both by
practice and purpose notorious Impostors, though they shadow
their delusive and cheating knaveries under divers and various pretences;
some pretending to do their Feats by Astrology (which
is a general Cheat as it is commonly used) some by a pretended gift
from God, when they are notoriously drunken, debauched, and
blasphemous persons, such as of very late years was the Cobler that
lived upon <em>Ellill</em> Moor, named <em>Richmond</em>, and divers others that I
could name, but that in modesty I would spare their reputations:
some by pretending skill in Natural Magick, when indeed they can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>hardly read English truly; some by pretending a familiar Spirit, as
one <em>Thomas Bolton</em> near <em>Knaresborough</em> in <em>Yorkshire</em>, when indeed
and in truth they have no other Familiar but their own Spirit of lying
and deceiving: some by pretending to reveal things in Crystal-glasses
or Beryls, as was well known to be pretended by Doctor
<em>Lamb</em>, and divers others that I have known. And some by pretending
to conjure and call up Devils, or the Spirits of men departed;
and some by many other ways and means that are not necessary to
be named here; for errour and deceit have a numerous train of
Followers and Disciples. And the existence of such kind of Witches
as these (if you will needs call them by that name, and not by
their proper titles, which are, that they truly are Deceivers, Cheaters,
Couseners, and Impostors) I willingly acknowledge, as having
been, and are to be found in all ages, and these sorts are also acknowledged
by <em>Wierus</em>, Mr. <em>Scot</em>, <em>Johannes Lazarus Gutierius</em>, <em>Tobias
Tandlerus</em>, <em>Hieronymus Nymannus</em>, <em>Martinius Biermannus</em>, and
all the rest, that notwithstanding did with might and main oppose
the gross Tenent of the common Witchmongers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Candle in the dark, p. 12, 13.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Object. p. 78.</div>

<p class='c008'>And of this sort were all those several differences of Diviners,
Witches, or Deceivers named in the Scriptures, as Mr. <em>Ady</em> hath
sufficiently declared in this passage, which we shall transcribe. “A
Witch is a man or woman that practiseth Devillish crafts of seducing
the people for gain, from the knowledge and worship of
God, and from the truth, to vain credulity (or believing of lyes)
or to the worshipping of Idols”. And again he saith: “Witchcraft
is a Devillish craft of seducing the people for gain, from the
knowledge and worship of God, and from his truth, to vain credulity
(or believing of lyes) or to the worshipping of Idols.
That it is a Craft truly so called, and likewise that it is for gain,
is proved <em>Act.</em> 16. 16, 19. The Maid that followed <em>Paul</em> crying,
brought in her Master much gain; and that it is a Craft of perverting
the people, or seducing them from God and his Truth,
is proved <em>Act.</em> 6. 7, 8. <em>Elimas the Sorcerer laboured to pervert
Deputy from the Faith.</em> So likewise <em>Act.</em> 8. 9, 10, 11. it doth
more plainly prove all these words: <em>And there was a man before
in the City called Simon, which used Witchcraft, and bewitched
the people of Samaria, saying, That he himself was some great
man, to whom they gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying,
This man is the great power of God, and gave heed unto him, because
that of long time he had bewitched them with Sorceries</em>.
How bewitched them with Sorceries? That is, seduced them
with Devillish Crafts: (as the Greek and also <em>Tremelius</em> Latine
Translation do more plainly illustrate.) In this sense speaketh <em>Paul</em>
to the <em>Galatians</em> 3. 1. <em>O foolish Galathians, who hath bewitched
you, that you should not obey the truth?</em> And that a Witch or
Witchcraft is taken in no other sense in all the Scripture, it appeareth
by the whole current of the Scriptures, as you may see
in this Book.” But against this Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> and the rest of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>opinion will object and say, that it is hard and severe that Cheaters
and Impostors should be ranked with Inchanters, and such as converse
with Devils and with Idolaters, and that of this it is hard to
give a reason. To this we shall give this full responsion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Levit. 20. 10.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Deut. 22. 22, 23, 24.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. We are to consider in what precise respect actions are in Sacred
Writ called sinful and wicked, and wherefore they have such
severe punishments annexed unto them, and we shall find that this
is not <i><span lang="la">ratione medii vel actùs, sed finis</span></i>. As for instance and illustration:
we shall find that the Law was peremptory in point of adultery,
which saith: <em>If a man be found lying with a woman married
to an husband, then they shall both of them dye</em>. Now the act of copulation,
as it is an act, is all one with a lawful wife, and with the
wife of another man (that is, one generically considered) and yet the
one is lawful, as agreeing with Gods Law and Ordinance, and the
other is unlawful, sinful, wicked, and therefore to be punished
with death, because it is an aberration from the Divine Ordinance,
and contrary to the Command of God, who saith, <em>Thou shalt not
commit adultery</em>. So though the things committed by these persons,
were or might be performed by natural or artificial means, that
simply in themselves were not sinful, or so severely punishable, yet
were they evil in regard of the end, which was to deceive and
seduce the people to Idolatry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Chron. 33. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</div>

<p class='c008'>Psal. 115. 4, 5,
6, 7. ibid. Psal.
135. 17.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Therefore the true and punctual reason why these persons
(termed Witches or Diviners) are by the Law of God so severely
to be punished, is, because they drew the people to Idolatry, the
thing that God most hateth, and against which he hath pronounced
the most severe and terriblest judgments of all. Nay these people
were the very false Prophets, especially of one sort, and the
very Priests to the Idols, as is manifest in the wicked and filthy
Idolatry of all sorts set up and practised by <em>Manasses</em>, even all the
sorts (or the most of them) mentioned in the Scriptures. And
God declareth himself to be a jealous God, and that he will not
give his glory to another, but is the only Lord God, and him only
we ought to serve; and therefore will most severely punish those
that attribute that unto Idols, that is only proper unto himself:
and for this cause, and upon this ground are all those terrible
Comminations used in the Scriptures, and especially against this
sort of people, who were the chief Instruments of promoting Idol-worship,
ascribing the power of a Deity unto them, when the Prophet
tells us, <em>Their idols are silver and gold, the work of mens
hands; they have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but
they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; noses have they,
but they smell not; they have hands but they handle not; feet have
they, but they walk not, neither speak they through their throat; neither
is there any breath in their mouths</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 King. 18.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. That many great and abstruse things may be lawfully done
by Natural Magick, is well known to the best Naturalists, and
how great Feats may be performed by the Mathematicks and Mechanical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Arts, are well known to the Learned; and that there is and
may be a lawful use of Astrology, and many things may be foretold
by it, few that are judicious are ignorant; that the Prognosticks
in the Art of Medicine are necessary, and of much use and
certainty, all learned Physicians know very well; that observing of
times, and many other such like things may for divers respects be
lawfully practised. But if all or any of these be used to draw people
to Idolatry, and their strange effects ascribed unto dumb and
dead Idols, then what horrible sin and abomination were this, and
no punishment could be too heavy for it. And so it is in the case
of these sort of people called Witches or Diviners, they perswaded
the multitude, that their false Gods (or rather Devils) in their
Idols, could foretel life or death, and so led the people a whoring
after them, as <em>Ahaziah</em> sent to inquire of the god of <em>Ekron</em>, whether
he should recover or not, and therefore he had that sharp
judgment, <em>That he should not come down from that bed whither he
was gone up, but should surely dye</em>. And did not the Priests of <em>Baal</em>
(which were the same rabble named <em>Deut.</em> 18. 10, 11, 12, 13, &#38;c.)
obstinately labour to make <em>Ahab</em> and all the people believe, that the
Gods (or Devils) that they worshipped in their Idols, could and
would answer by fire, and pertinaciously persisted in their obstinacy,
<em>cutting themselves with knives and lancets from morning until
the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice</em>, and yet nothing was
effected? so that they were justly guilty of that punishment which
they received, which was death, for ascribing that to a dead Idol,
that none could perform, but the only true God of <em>Israel</em>, and yet
in the meantime could neither by their own skill, nor the skill of
their Idols foresee that sudden death that fell upon them: which
punishment fell deservedly upon them, for labouring to deceive the
people, and confirm them in Idolatry, in ascribing that unto a dead
stock, which was only in the power of the Almighty to perform.
So if all those fine Knacks and neat Tricks that <em>Athanasius Kircher</em>
performed at <em>Rome</em> by the help and means of the Loadstone, and
mentioned in his Book <i><span lang="co">de Arte Magnetica</span></i>, had been by him ascribed
unto some Saint, thereby to have drawn the people to the adoration
of that Saint, and so to Idolatry, it had been active imposture,
deceit, and knavery in him, and he might justly have been
inrolled in the Catalogue of these Witches or Diviners, and had
really been an active Impostor, as they were, and so had deserved
the same punishment: when on the contrary for ascribing effects unto
their true and proper causes, and clearly shewing the manner and
means of producing those effects, he hath justly deserved the title
of a learned and honest man. And though a common <em>Hocus Pocus</em>
man, or one that playeth Tricks of Leger-de-main or slight of
hand, to get a livelihood by, do labour to make the ignorant multitude
believe that he doth his Feats by virtue of his barbarous terms
or non-significant words, or by the help of some familiar Spirit;
must therefore a prudent or learned person believe the same, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>not labour to understand that those pretences are but used the better
to deceive the senses of the beholders, and so that pretence but
a cheat and imposture?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isa. 44. 15, 16.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. We affirm that all these mentioned in the Scriptures (nay,
and that the Priests attending all the so famoused Oracles) were but
meer Cheaters and Impostors, and that for these reasons. 1. They
could not be, nor were ignorant that all their numerous Idols were
but the works of mens hands, and that they could not of themselves
move, see, hear, smell, or breathe, much less eat and drink;
and therefore were notorious Cheaters and Impostors in labouring
to make the people believe the contrary. 2. They could not be
ignorant but what answers were given, and what acts were done,
were performed by themselves, and not by the Idols, and yet they
laboured to make the people believe the contrary, as the <em>Bramines</em>
and Priests do to this day all over the Eastern parts of <em>Asia</em>, and in
many other places, and so must needs be notorious Knaves and
Cheaters; because, as <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i> saith, <em>With part of the wood whereof
he hath made himself an Idol, he maketh a fire and warmeth himself</em>.
3. They could not be ignorant that their Idols could not,
nor did declare any thing truly that was to come, but what Answers
were given, or Divinations were uttered, were of their own
devising and invention, and no other Devil in the case, but Diabolical
inspirations in their minds. And this is manifest by their pitiful
shuffling equivocations (especially of all the Oracles) their responsions
being always ambiguous, and bearing a double sense,
which caused <em>Cardan</em> to say: “<i><span lang="la">Oracula, si non essent ambigua, non
essent oracula.</span></i>” And commonly (if not always) they were given
in the favour of those that gave the largest gifts, which made <em>Demosthenes</em>
say, that the Oracle at <em>Delphos</em> did <span lang="grc">φιλιππίζειν</span>, because it always
spoke in favour of <em>Philip</em> and his proceedings. And it was
with the Oracles, as with the Temple of <em>Neptune</em>, All the Offerings
of those that escaped shipwrack were preserved, and to be seen; but
of those that had suffered shipwrack, there was no memorial nor
knowledge of their number: so, many have noted some few Hits of
the Oracles, but few have noted their Misses, which doubtless were
far the greater number. For so it is here in this North Country
with our Figure-flingers and pretended Conjurers, Piss-Prophets,
and Water-Witches, that if they hit once, it is cryed up and told
every where; but if they erre an hundred times, it is soon buried
in silence and oblivion, and one fool will not take warning at anothers
being cheated and deceived. And that their Idols did not,
nor could declare truly what was to come, is manifest by the Prophet
who saith: <em>Let them bring them forth</em> (that is, their Idols)
<em>and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things what
they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;
or declare us things for to come. Shew the things that are to come
hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea do good or do
evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.</em> Yet these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>miserable, cheating, dissembling Wretches that would have had the
multitude to have believed, that their Idols could have foretold
truly almost any thing; yet neither their Idols, nor the Gods (or Devils)
they pretended to be in them, nor themselves could foretel or
foresee their own destruction, as is manifest in the Prophets of <em>Baal</em>
in the time of <em>Elijah</em>, who went up to Mount <em>Carmel</em> to advance
the worship and power of their Idols, but did not foresee it should
be all their destructions and deaths. Doubtless those that in the
Book of <em>Daniel</em> are called Wise-men, Magicians, Astrologers, Sorcerers,
and Chaldeans were endowed with much rare knowledge,
both in respect of Nature and Art: for if their knowledge had
been Diabolical, without question <em>Daniel</em> would hardly have interceded
for them, yet could they not reveal what the Kings dream
was that was gone from him, nor foresee that they run the hazard
of their lives; but did conclude that none other could shew it,
except the <em>gods whose dwelling is not with flesh</em>. 4. In matters
of fact it appeareth, that they were active deceivers and deluders,
as is manifest when <em>Pharaoh</em> had dreamed two dreams, that he called
and sent for all the Magicians and Wise-men of <em>Egypt</em>; but they
could not interpret them unto him. <em>Junius</em> and <em>Tremelius</em> render
it: <i><span lang="la">Omnes Magos Ægypti, &#38; omnes Sapientes ejus</span></i>. The vulgar
Latine (or that which is improperly called St. <em>Hieromes</em> Translation)
gives it: <i><span lang="la">Misit ad omnes Conjectores Ægypti, cunctósq; Sapientes</span></i>.
And these doubtless <em>Pharaoh</em> would not have sent for, but
that either upon his own knowledge he knew that they professed
the ability of the interpretation of dreams, and (perhaps) as the
sequel shewed, greater matters; or else upon common repute, or relation
of others, and that must needs arise from their own profession
of the knowledge of such abstruse matters: and so of necessity
must have pretended greater matters, than when they came to tryal
they were able to perform, and so must needs be Impostors. And
the Woman at <em>Endor</em> (falsely called a Witch, or a Woman that
had a familiar Spirit, when in the Hebrew she is only called the
Mistress of the Bottle, as we shall manifest hereafter) must needs be
a Deceiver and Impostor, because she pretended to bring up whomsoever
<em>Saul</em> desired, which was a thing absolutely not in her power,
as I shall undeniably prove afterwards. And notwithstanding
the stories of <em>Eusebius</em>, and the strong endeavours of Doctor
<em>Hamond</em> to make it good, that <em>Simon Magus</em> was a person that
had peculiar and corporeal converse with the Devil, and by that
league and converse could perform strange and wonderful things;
yet was he but a notorious Impostor, as appeareth by two reasons.
1. The Text saith, <em>that he gave out that himself was some great
one</em>, that is, that he had great skill, and was able to perform wonderful
things. This sheweth his presumption and pretence, the certain
badge of a Deceiver and Cheater. 2. But could do little, except
some petty jugling Tricks of Leger-de-main, confederacy, and
the like; <em>because he wondred, or was amazed, beholding the Miracles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and signs which were done, and those were, that unclean Spirits,
crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed
with them: And many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were
healed</em>. Now if he had been any great Magician, or could have
performed any great things, he could not have so much wondred
at those things that <em>Philip</em> wrought: or if he could have flown in
the air, as <em>Eusebius</em> (or those that have foisted such incredible lyes
into his Writings) pretendeth, then he need not have been so amazed
at the miracles and signs that the Apostles wrought, nor to have
offered to have bought the gift of bestowing the Holy Ghost, but
only because he was a notorious Dissembler and Impostor. And if
he had been in league with the Devil, surely he might have cast forth
Devils by the power of <em>Beelzebub</em> the Prince of Devils: all which
do plainly conclude him to be an absolute Cheater and Impostor.
And the story of <em>Bel</em> and the <em>Dragon</em> (though but an Apocryphal
piece, yet very ancient, and of sufficient credit as to matter of fact)
doth evidently demonstrate, that these sort of people were abominable
Cheaters and Impostors, and were not endowed with any supernatural
power, nor had assistance of any visible Demon, but only
the Devil of deceit and cousenage in their own breasts, and so
were, as <em>Cardan</em> saith, <i><span lang="la">Carnales Dæmones ipsis Dæmonibus callidiores</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Instit. p. 3. p. 45.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. And though by the Laws of our own Nation these kind of
people were to be severely punished, as appeareth by the Statute
<em>1 Jac. cap. 12.</em> yet had they respect in that Act, not only to the punishment
in respect of what these persons could or did do, but also
in regard of their being Impostors and Deceivers of the people;
for so the Lord Chief Justice Sir <em>Edward Cook</em>, the best Expositor of
Law that hath written in our Language, doth expound it in these
words. The mischiefs before this part of this Act were: “<em>That divers
Impostors, men and women, would take upon them to tell or
do these fine things here specified, in great deceit of the people, and
cheating and cousening them of their money or other goods: therefore
was this part of the Act made, wherein these words [take upon
him or them] are very remarkable. For if they take upon them,
&#38;c. though in truth they do it not, yet are they in danger of this
first branch.</em>”</p>

<p class='c008'>6. And whereas in the objection Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> mentioneth converse
with Devils, if he mean mental, internal, and spiritual converse,
such as Murtherers, Adulterers, Thieves, Robbers, and all
wicked persons have with Satan, we grant it; for so had the Jews
and the High Priests in conspiring and acting to put our blessed
Saviour to death: <em>it was their hour, and the power of darkness</em>.
But if he mean a visible and corporeal converse, then we plainly
affirm that there is not, nor can be any such, whereby any such
strange things (as Witchmongers fondly and falsely believe) can
be performed or effected. Therefore by way of conclusion in this
particular, we grant that there are many sorts of such kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Witches, as for gain and vain-glory do take upon them to declare
hidden and occult things, to divine of things that are to come, and
to do many wonderful matters, but that they are but Cheaters,
Deceivers, and Couseners.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. And as there are a numerous crew of active Witches, whose
existence we freely acknowledge; so there are another sort, that
are under a passive delusion, and know not, or at least do not observe
or understand, that they are deluded or imposed upon. These
are those that confidently believe that they see, do, and suffer many
strange, odd, and wonderful things, which have indeed no existence
at all in them, but only in their depraved fancies, and are
meerly <i><span lang="la">melancholiæ figmenta</span></i>. And yet the confessions of these,
though absurd, idle, foolish, false, and impossible, are without all
ground and reason by the common Witchmongers taken to be
truths, and falsely ascribed unto Demons, and that they are sufficient
grounds to proceed upon to condemn the Confessors to death,
when all is but passive delusion, intrinsecally wrought in the depraved
imaginative faculty by these three ways or means.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. One of the Causes that produceth this depraved and passive
delusion, is evil education; they being bred up in ignorance, either
of God, the Scriptures, or the true grounds of Christian Religion,
nay not being taught the common Rules of Morality, or of
other humane Literature; but only imbibing and sucking in, with
their mothers and nurses milk, the common gross and erroneous
opinions that the blockish vulgar people do hold, who are all generally
inchanted and bewitched with the belief of the strange
things related of Devils, Apparitions, Fayries, Hobgoblins, Ghosts,
Spirits, and the like: so that thereby a most deep impression of the
verity of the most gross and impossible things is instamped in their
fancies, hardly ever after in their whole life time to be obliterated
or washt out: so prevalent a thing is Custom and Institution from
young years, though the things thus received, and pertinaciously
believed, and adhered unto, are most abominable falsities and impossibilities,
having no other existence but in the brains and phantasies
of old, ignorant, and doting persons, and are meerly <i><span lang="la">muliercularum
&#38; nutricum terriculamenta &#38; figmenta</span></i>, and therefore
did <em>Seneca</em> say: <i><span lang="la">Gravissimum est consuetudinis imperium</span></i>. And that
this is one main cause of this delusion, is manifest from all the best
Historians, that where the light of the Gospel hath least appeared,
and where there is the greatest brutish ignorance and heathenish
Barbarism, there the greatest store of these deluded Witches or
Melancholists are to be found, as in the North of <em>Scotland</em>, <em>Norway</em>,
<em>Lapland</em>, and the like, as may be seen at large in <i><span lang="la">Saxo Grammaticus</span></i>,
<em>Olaus Magnus</em>, <em>Hector Boetius</em>, and the like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Schenck. observ. medic.</em> <em>lib.</em> 1. <em>pag.</em> 129.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. But when an atrabilarious Temperament, or a melancholick
Complexion and Constitution doth happen to those people bred in
such ignorance, and that have suckt in all the fond opinions that
Custom and Tradition could teach them, then what thing can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>imagined that is strange, wonderful, or incredible, but these people
do pertinaciously believe it, and as confidently relate it to others?
nay even things that are absolutely impossible, as that they are
really changed into Wolves, Hares, Dogs, Cats, Squirrels, and the
like; and that they flye in the Air, are present at great Feasts and
Meetings, and do strange and incredible things, when all these are
but the meer effects of the imaginative function depraved by the
fumes of the melancholick humor, as we might shew from the Writings
of the most grave and learned Physicians; but we shall content
our selves with some few select ones. 1. That distemper which
Physicians call <em>Lycanthropia</em>, is according to the judgment of <em>Aetius</em>
and <em>Paulus</em>, but a certain species of Melancholy, and yet they
really think and believe themselves to be Wolves, and imitate their
actions: of which <em>Johannes Fincelius</em> in his second Book <i><span lang="la">de Mirac.</span></i>
giveth us a relation to this purpose. “That at <em>Padua</em> in the year
1541. a certain Husband-man did seem to himself a Wolf, and
did leap upon many in the fields, and did kill them. And that
at last he was taken not without much difficulty, and did confidently
affirm that he was a true Wolf, only that the difference
was in the skin turned in with the hairs. And therefore that certain,
having put off all humanity, and being truly truculent and
voracious, did smite and cut off his legs and arms, thereby to try
the truth of the matter; but the innocency of the man being
known, they commit him to the Chirurgions to be cured, but
that he dyed not many days after.” Which instance is sufficient to
overthrow the vain opinion of those men that believe that a man or
woman may be really transformed or transubstantiated into a Wolf,
Dog, Cat, Squirrel, or the like, without the operation of an omnipotent
power, as in <em>Lots</em> Wife becoming a Pillar of Salt; though
St. <em>Augustine</em> was so weak as to seem to believe the reality of these
transformations: of which we shall have occasion to speak more
largely hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observat. medic.</em> <em>lib.</em> 1. <em>cap.</em> 18. <em>pag.</em> 38.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Another story we shall give from the Authority of that learned
Physician <em>Nicolaus Tulpius</em> of <em>Amsterdam</em> to this effect. A certain
famous Painter was for a long time infected with black Choler,
and did falsely imagine that all the bones of his body were as
soft and flexible, that they might be drawn and bended like soft
wax. Which opinion being deeply imprinted in his mind, he kept
himself in bed the whole Winter, fearing that if he should rise, they
would not bear his weight, but would shrink together by reason of
their softness. That <em>Tulpius</em> did not contradict him in that fancy,
but said that it was a distemper that Physicians were not ignorant
of, but had been long before noted by <em>Fernelius</em>, that the bones
like wax might be softned and indurated, and that it might be easily
cured, if he would be obedient: and that within three days he
would make the bones firm and stable, and that within six days he
would restore him to the power of walking. By which promises
it was hard to declare, how much hope of recovering health it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>raised up in him, and how obedient it made him. So that with Medicines
proper to purge the atrabilarious humour within the time
appointed, he was at the three days end suffered to stand upon his
feet, and upon the sixth day had leave given to walk abroad: and
so found himself perfectly sound afterwards; but did not perceive
the deceit in his phantasie, that had made him lye a whole Winter
in bed, though he was no stupid, but an ingenious person in his Art,
and scarce second to any.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vt supr. Histor.</em> 85. <em>pag.</em> 125.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. <em>Thomas Bartholinus</em> the famous Anatomist, and Physician to
<em>Frederick</em> the Third King of <em>Denmark</em>, tells us these things: “That
it is the property of melancholy persons to fear things not to be
feared, and to feign things <i><span lang="la">quæ nec picta usquam sunt, nec scripta</span></i>.
A <em>Plebeian</em> (he saith) with them abounding with melancholy
blood did imagine that his Nose was grown to that greatness,
that he durst not go abroad, for fear it should be hurt or justled
upon by those he met. And that a famous Poet at <em>Amsterdam</em>
did believe that his Buttocks were of glass, and feared their
breaking, if he should sit down. Another Old man of prime
Dignity did suspect that he had swallowed a nail, which being
lost, he could no where find, and thought himself much tortured
by its being fixed in him. But was restored to his health, by
having a Vomit given, and the Physician conveying a nail into
the matter that he cast up. And that a certain man in <em>England</em>
would not make water, for fear that all the blood in his body
should have passed forth by that passage, and therefore straitly
tyed the yard with a thred for some days, which swelling he was
not far from death, but that his Brother by force untyed it.” The
Books of Physicians are very full with such relations, and we in
our Practice have met with divers as strange as these, and cured
them. Also he tells us this: “A certain Student of a melancholick
Constitution, distracted with grief for the death of a Sister,
and wearied with lucubrations, did complain to (<em>Bartholinus</em>)
of the Devil haunting of him: and did affirm that he felt the evil
Spirit enter by his fundament with wind, and so did creep up his
body until it possessed the head, lest he might attend his Prayers
and Meditations with his accustomed devotion, and that it did
descend and go forth the same way, when he bent himself to
Prayers, and reading of Sacred Books. Before these things he
used to be filled with unheard of joy from his assiduous Prayers
and watching, that also he had heard a celestial kind of Musick,
and therefore despising all mortal things, he had distributed all
things to the poor; but that now piety waxing cold by too much
appetite after meat, and his brain troubled with that wind, that
he had heard a voice of one in his brain upbraiding him with
Blasphemy, and that he felt hands beating, and a stink passing
before his nose. By all which <em>Bartholinus</em> guessed, that it was
Hypochondriacal Melancholy, and by good Counsel, proper Physick,
merry Company, and rightly ordering of him, he was perfectly
cured.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Histor. medic. mirab.</em> <em>l.</em> 2. <em>c.</em> 1. <em>p.</em> 33.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>4. To these we will only add this that is related by <em>Marcellus
Donatus</em>, Physician to the Duke of <em>Mantua</em> and <em>Montferrat</em>, to
this purpose. “That he knew a Noble Countess of their City,
that did most earnestly affirm, that she was made sick by the
Witchery and Incantation of a certain ill-minded Woman; which
was apprehended by a learned Physician to be, notwithstanding
her fancy, nothing else but Hypochondriacal Melancholy, which
he cured by giving her proper Medicaments to purge that humour,
and ordering her Waiting-maid to put into the matter she
voided Nails, Feathers, and Needles; which when with a glad
countenance she had shewed to her Mistress, she presently cryed
out that she had not been deceived, when she had referred the
cause of her disease to Witchcraft, and afterwards did daily recover
more and more.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relat. of <em>Lancash.</em> Witches.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. And as ignorance and irreligion meeting with a melancholick
Constitution, doth frame many persons to strange fancies both of
fear and credulity: so when to these is added the teachings of
those that are themselves under a most strong passive delusion, then
of all others these become most strongly confident that they can
perform admirable things. As when a person hath by education
suckt in all the grossest fables and lyes of the power of Witches
and familiar Devils, and therein becometh extremely confident,
heightned with the fumes of black Choler, and so thinks, meditates,
and dreameth of Devils, Spirits, and all the strange stories
that have been related of them, and becometh maliciously stirred
up against some Neighbour or other: And so in that malicious
and revengeful mind seeketh unto, and inquireth for some famed
and notorious Witch, of whom they believe they may learn such
craft and cunning, that thereby they may be able to kill or destroy
the persons or goods of those that they suppose have done them
injuries. Then meeting with some that are strongly deluded, and
confidently perswaded, that they have the company and assistance
of a familiar Spirit, by whose help they believe they can do (almost)
any thing, especially in destroying men or cattel, they are
presently instructed what vain and abominable Ceremonies, Observances,
Unguents, Charms, making of Pictures, and a thousand such
fond, odd fopperies they are to use, by which they believe they can
do strange Feats. And from this do proceed their bold and confident
confessions of lyes and impossibilities, that notwithstanding
have abused so many to take them for certain truths: so that according
to the Proverb, <em>Popery and Witchcraft go by Tradition</em>:
and we shall find none of these deluded Witches (if they must be
so called) but they have been taught by others, that thought themselves
to be such also. And this is a truth, if we may trust the
confession of <em>Alizon Denice</em> at the Bar at <em>Lancaster</em>, who saith thus:
“That about two years agone her Grandmother called <em>Elizabeth
Sotheres, alias Dembdike</em>, did (sundry times in going or walking
together, as they went begging) perswade and advise this Examinate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to let a Devil or a Familiar appear to her, and that she
this Examinate would let him suck at some part of her, and she
might have and do what she would.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But besides these two sorts of Witches, whose Existence we deny
not, there is an acceptation of the word <em>Witch</em> in another sense, the
Existence of which I absolutely deny, and that is this according to
Mr. <em>Perkins</em>. “A Witch is a Magician, who either by open or secret
League wittingly and willingly consenteth to use the aid
and assistance of the Devil in the working of Wonders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the full Description and Notion that the common Witchmongers
give a Witch is this. “That a Witch is such a person to
whom the Devil doth appear in some visible shape, with whom
the Witch maketh a League or Covenant, sometimes by Bond
signed with the Witches blood, and that thereby he doth after
suck upon some part of their bodies, and that they have carnal
Copulation together, and that by virtue of that League the
Witch can be changed into an Hare, Dog, Cat, Wolf, or such like
Creatures; that they can flye in the air, raise storms and tempests,
kill men or cattel, and such like wonders.” This notion of a Witch
may be gathered from the Writings of these persons, <em>Delrio</em> the Jesuit,
<em>Bodinus</em>, <i><span lang="la">Jacobus Springerus</span></i>, <em>Johannes Niderus</em>, <em>Bartholomeus
Spineus</em>, <em>Paulus Grillandus</em>, <em>Lambertus Danæus</em>, <em>Hemmingius</em>, <em>Erastus</em>,
<em>Sennertus</em>, and many others. As also from the Writings of
our own Country-men, Mr. <em>Perkins</em>, Mr. <em>Bernard</em> of <em>Balcombe</em>, the
Author of the Book called Demonology, Mr. <em>Gaule</em>, Mr. <em>Giffard</em>,
and divers others, who have from one to another lickt up the Vomit
of the first Broacher of this vain and false opinion, and without
due consideration have laboured to obtrude it upon others.
Yet was it in a manner rejected by the most of the Learned, who
had duly weighed the matter, and read the strong and convincing
arguments of <em>Wierus</em>, <em>Tandlerus</em>, <em>Nymannus</em>, <em>Biermannus</em>, <em>Gutierrius</em>,
Mr. <em>Scot</em>, and the like, until of late years Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> and
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> have taken up Weapons to defend these false, absurd,
impossible, impious, and bloody opinions withal, against whose arguments
we now principally direct our Pen, and after the answering
of their groundless and unjust scandals, we shall labour to overthrow
their chief Bulwarks and Fortifications.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Having declared in what sense and acceptation we allow of
Witches, and in what notion we deny them, lest we be misunderstood
we shall add thus much: That we do not (as the
Schools speak) deny the existence of Witches <i><span lang="la">absolutè &#38; simpliciter,
sed secundùm quid</span></i>, and that they do not exist <i><span lang="it">tali modo</span></i>, that
is, they do not make a visible Contract with the Devil, he doth not
suck upon their bodies, they have not carnal Copulation with him,
and the like recited before, and in these respects, and not otherwise,
did <em>Wierus</em>, <em>Gutierrius</em> and Mr. <em>Scot</em> deny Witches, that is, that neither
they nor their supposed Familiars could perform such things
as are ascribed unto them. And that Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> and Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>
should charge those that hold this opinion with Atheism or
Sadducism, is to me very strange, having no ground, connexion, or
rational consequence so to do: yet doth Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> affirm it in
these words: “Now one prime foundation (saith he) of Atheism,
as by many ancient and late is observed, being the not believing
the existence of spiritual Essences, whether good or bad, separate,
or united, subordinate to God, as to the supreme and original
Cause of all; and by consequent the denying of supernatural
operations: I have, I confess, applied my self, by my examples,
which in this case do more than any reasoning, and (the Authority
of the holy Scriptures laid aside) are almost the only convincing
proof.” And Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> is so confident (I might justly
say impudent) that he styled his Book, <em>A Blow at modern Sadducism</em>,
which, I confess, is so weak a blow, and so blindly levell’d,
and so improperly directed, that I am sure it will kill or
hurt no body: and tells us this boldly and roundly. “And those
that dare not bluntly say, <em>There is no God</em>, content themselves,
(for a fair step and introduction) to deny there are Spirits or
Witches. Which sort of Infidels, though they are not ordinary
among the meer Vulgar, yet are they numerous in a little higher
rank of understandings. And those that know any thing of the
World, know that most of the looser Gentry, and the small Pretenders
to Philosophy and Wit, are generally deriders of the belief
of Witches and Apparitions.” And the whole design of his
Book is to prove those men to be guilty of Sadducism, that deny
the existence of Witches understood in his sense, and this we oppose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and the state of the question we lye down thus.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the denying the existence of Angels or Spirits; or the Resurrection,
doth not infer the denying of the Being of God; nor
the denying of the existence of Witches (in the sense before laid
down) infer the denying of Angels or Spirits; and that they do unjustly
charge the Authors of this opinion with Sadducism, we shall
prove with irrefragable Arguments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. There can be no right deduction made, nor no right consequence
drawn, where there is no dependency in causality, nor no
connexion of dependency. For as in the Relative and Correlative,
the denying of the one necessarily destroys the other, yet <i><span lang="la">fundamentum
Relationis non destruitur</span></i>; so a father without a child, as a
father, doth neither exist nor is known, and yet the foundation of
those two terms, of Paternity and Childship, which is Man, doth
remain. So he that denieth Creation, doth destroy the Relative,
which is Creator; yet the foundation, which is God, doth remain:
and the denying of the Creation, doth not infer the necessary conclusion
of denying the Being of a God, because there might be a
God, though there were no Creation, because God is supposed to
be, both in respect of causality and duration, before Creation. So
what relation can Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> feign betwixt the Being of God and
the Being of Angels or Spirits? For they both belong to the Predicament
of Substance, and not that of Relation; and there is less
relation betwixt the Being of a Witch and the Being of Spirits:
so that the denying of the one doth not infer the denying of the
other. And though there were relation (which Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> cannot
shew) the foundation of that Relation (which is so necessary,
that Relatives cannot subsist without it) might remain, though the
Relatives were taken away: and therefore the denying of the existence
of Angels or Spirits, doth not infer the denying of the Being
of God; and therefore the Authors of this opinion are wrongfully
and falsely charged with Atheism: and the denying of the existence
of a Witch (in the sense specified) doth not infer the denying of
the Being of Spirits; and therefore <em>Scot</em>, <em>Osburne</em>, and the like, are
falsely and wrongfully charged with Sadducism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Mat. 22. 23. Act. 23. 8.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Though it be a true Maxime, that <i><span lang="la">de posse ad esse non valet
argumentum</span></i>; yet on the contrary, the possibility of that can never
be rationally denied, that hath once been in <em>esse</em>. But it is apparent,
that the Sadducees denied the Resurrection, and that there
were either Angels or Spirits, that is, they denied that Angels or
Spirits, whether good or bad, did separately exist, and that they
were nothing but the good or bad motions in mens minds: yet
these men were no Atheists; for though they denied the Resurrection,
and held that there were no Angels or Spirits, yet they held
and believed there was a God, and did allow of, and believed the
five Books of <em>Moses</em>, else would not our Saviour have used an argument,
whose only strength was drawn from a sentence in the third
Chapter of <em>Exodus</em>, the sixth verse. So that even the denying of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the Existence of Angels and Spirits, doth not infer the denying
of a God; much less doth the denying the Existence of a Witch,
infer the denial of the Being of Angels and Spirits; and therefore
the charge of Atheism and Sadducism is false, injurious, and scandalous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Those things that in their Beings have no dependence one
upon another, the denying of the one doth not takeaway or deny
the being of the other; but where the being doth meerly exist in
dependency upon another superior Cause, there take away or deny
the being of the first Cause, and thereby you take away and deny
the being of all the rest that depends upon it. So he that denies
the Being of a God, doth necessarily deny the Being of Angels or
Spirits; but not on the contrary. For he that denieth the Existence
of Angels and Spirits, doth not therefore necessarily take
away or deny the Being of a God, because the Being of a God is
independent of either Angel or Spirit, and doth exist solely by it
self. And therefore if <em>Wierus</em> or <em>Scot</em> had denied the Existence of
Angels and Spirits (which they did not) yet it would not have inferred
that they were Atheists; and therefore are falsely accused
by Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> and Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>. And though they should have
denied the Existence of Witches (which they did not <i><span lang="la">simpliciter,
sed tali modo</span></i>) yet it would not have inferred, that they were
guilty of Sadducism, because Spirits or Demons have their Existence
without any dependence of the being of Witches; and therefore
it is but a poor <i><span lang="la">fallacia consequentiæ</span></i> to say, he that denies a
Witch, denies a Demon or Spirit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. The denying of the Existence of Spirits, doth not infer the
denying of the Being of a God, because in the priority of duration
God was when Spirits were not, for they are not immortal <i><span lang="la">à parte
anté</span></i>. So likewise the denying of the Existence of Witches, doth
not infer the denial of the Being of Spirits, for in the priority
of duration Spirits were existent before Witches; for <em>Adam</em> and
<em>Eve</em> could not be ignorant that there were Spirits, both good and
bad, and yet then there were no Witches. So that a Spirit having,
in respect of duration, a Being before that a Witch can have any;
the denying the Existence of the latter, doth not infer the denying
of the Being of the former, but is meerly inconsequent, agreeable
to no Rules of Logick, except that of Logger-head Colledge.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. Many properties or proper adjuncts may be ascribed unto a
substance, the denying of which adjuncts, doth not infer the denying
of the being of the substance. So that to deny that a Horse
hath fins like a fish, or wings like a bird, doth not infer the denying
of the being of a Horse. Therefore it is injurious and scandalous
in Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> and Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, to charge Dr. <em>Wierus</em> and
Mr. <em>Scot</em> with Atheism and Sadducism, when indeed (as we shall
prove hereafter) their own Tenents tend to blasphemy, impiety,
vanity, and uncharitableness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another thing that we oppose is, that Apparitions are no warrantable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>ground for a Christian to believe the Existence of Angels
and Spirits by, but the Word of God, which these cogent reasons
do sufficiently prove.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. For to say that the Apparitions of Spirits, good or bad, do
prove their Existence, is but <i><span lang="la">petitio principii</span></i>, a begging of the
question, that first is in doubt, and ought to be proved. For how
come we to be assured, that the Apparitions that are made, and
really by unquestionable Witnesses attested for truth (not to speak
of melancholy Fancies, and Fables, Knacks of Knavery and Imposture,
and other ignorant and gross mistakes, which are often believed
to be Apparitions, when they are no such matter) that they
are made by good or bad Spirits? for that is the thing in doubt, and
so is but a circular way of arguing by way of begging the question,
or proving <i><span lang="la">ignotum per ignotius</span></i>; for Apparitions do not prove
the Being of Spirits, except it be first proved, that those Apparitions
be made or caused by Spirits.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. There are many Apparitions that are produced by natural and
artificial Causes, and need not be referred to supernatural ones, as are
all those <em>Idola</em>, Images, or Species that we see in Glasses, which cannot
be denied to be Apparitions, and yet arise from natural Causes.
So the Apparition of Comets, new Stars, and many other sort of
strange Meteors, as sometimes three Suns, the Rain-bow, <em>Halones</em>,
and the like, that have natural Causes to produce them, and are no
proof of the Being of Spirits. Nay as the best and most credible
Historians have left upon Record, and hath been known to be a
certain verity in divers parts of these three Kingdoms, within the
space of these forty years, strange and various Sights have been seen
in the Air, both of Men, and Horses, and Armies fighting one with
another; and yet were these no proof of the Existence of Spirits,
because they may (and doubtlesly do) proceed from other causes,
and not from the operation or efficiency of Angels or Spirits, either
good or bad.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. It is not certainly known what diversity of Creatures there
may be that are <i><span lang="la">mediæ naturæ</span></i> betwixt Angels and Men, that may
sometimes appear, and then vanish: so that if it be granted, that
there be Apparitions really and truly, yet it will not necessarily
follow, that these are caused by good or bad Angels, because they
may be effected by Creatures of another and middle Nature; and
so Apparitions no certain ground for the believing of the Existence
of Angels or Spirits. For the most learned <em>Drusius</em> gives us this account
from one of the Commentators upon the Book <em>Aboth</em>. “<i><span lang="la">Debet
homo intelligere ac scire à terra usq; ad firmamentum, quod
Rakia, id est, Expansum appellant, omnia plena esse turmis &#38; præfectis,
&#38; infrà plurimas esse creaturas lædentes &#38; accusantes, omnésq;
stare ac volare in aëre, neq; à terra usq; ad firmamentum
locum esse vacuum: sed omnia plena esse præpositis, quorum alii ad
pacem, alii ad bellum, alii ad bonum, alii ad malum; ad vitam &#38;
ad mortem incitant. Ob id compositum fuit canticum occursuum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>quod incipit, Sedet in occulto Supremus.</span></i>” And if this be a truth,
here are orders and numbers enough of several sorts to make Apparitions,
and yet be neither the good or bad Angels. And if
there may any credit be given to the relation that <em>Cardan</em> gives of
his Father <em>Facius Cardanus</em>, which he had from his own mouth, and
also had left it in writing; then “there are mortal Demons, that
are born and do die as men do, that can appear and disappear,
and are of such most tenuious bodies, that they can afford us
neither help nor, hurt, excepting terrors, and spectres, and knowledge”.
And if there may be credit given to <em>Plutarch</em> (so highly
magnified by Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>) the God <em>Pan</em> of the Heathens must have
been one of these mortal Demons, because he tells us upon the credit
of <em>Epotherses</em> (a Tale of hear-say) “That <em>Thamus</em> was by a
voice thrice calling upon him, commanded that when he came to
<em>Palodes</em>, he should tell them, that the great God <em>Pan</em> was dead”.
And that there are such mortal Demons, is strongly asserted by
<em>Paracelsus</em>, and by him called <em>Nymphæ</em>, <em>Sylphi</em>, <em>Pygmæi</em>, and <em>Salamandræ</em>,
and that they are not of <em>Adams</em> Generation, and that they
have wonderful power and skill. And to this opinion do the
Schools both of the ancient and later Academicks wholly incline,
and seems to be favoured both by Dr. <em>Moor</em> and Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> himself;
and if there be any such matters, doubtless from thence did
arise all the strange stories and gests that former Generations have
told and believed concerning the Apparition of these kind of
Creatures, which the common people call <em>Fayries</em>: of which the
Reverend and Learned person Bishop <em>Hall</em> giveth us this touch:
“The times are not past the ken of our memory, since the frequent
(and in some part true) reports of those familiar Devils,
Fayries, and Goblins, wherewith many places were commonly
haunted; the rarity whereof in these latter times, is sufficient to
descry the difference betwixt the state of ignorant Superstition,
and the clear light of the Gospel.” And whosoever shall seriously
read and consider that little Piece that was printed some few years
since, though written long ago, and by some (that pretend to no
small share of Learning) cryed up exceedingly for a most convincing
Relation, to prove the Existence of Spirits, called, <em>The Devil of
Mascon</em>, may easily gather, that if the thing were truly related, as
to the matter of fact, that it must needs be some Creature of a
middle Nature, and no evil Spirit, both because it was such a sportful
and mannerly Creature, that it would leave them, and not disturb
them at their devotions; as also (as far as I remember, for I
have not the Book by me) because it denied that it was a Devil,
and professed that it hoped to be saved by Christ.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. That the Scriptures contain in them all things necessary to
Salvation, is so clear a truth, that none but those that are wilfully
blind can deny it; for Christ taught his Disciples <em>all things that
he had learned of the Father</em>, and the Father sending him to be the
Saviour of the World, and to preach the Gospel of eternal Salvation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was not defective in declaring all things that were necessary
to accomplish the work and end, for which he was sent forth of the
Father. And the glorious Apostle St. <em>Paul</em> tells the Disciples and
Brethren, <em>That he had not shunned to declare unto them all the
counsel of God</em>, which must of necessity be abundantly sufficient
for their Salvations. And he telleth <em>Timothy</em>, <em>That he had known
the Scriptures from a child, which were able to make him wise unto
salvation. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished
unto all good works.</em> Nay the Woman of <em>Samaria</em> had so much
knowledge and faith, that she believed <em>that when the Messias was
come, he would tell them all things</em>. Now to the obtaining of Salvation,
there is nothing more necessary than to know what enemies
men have to fight against in their Christian Warfare, which
the Apostle tells in these words: <em>For we wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
rulers of the darkness of this world, against Spiritual wickedness in
high places: Wherefore they are to take unto them the whole armor
of God</em>, <span lang="grc">πανοπλίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <em>that they may be able to stand against the
wiles of the Devil</em>, <span lang="grc">μεθοδείας τοῦ διαβόλου</span>: and that made the Apostle say
in another place, <em>We are not ignorant of his devices or crafts</em>, <span lang="grc">νοήματα</span>.
Now the Scriptures being able to make us wise to Salvation, it
hath sufficiently declared the natures, powers, knowledge, and
offices of both the good and bad Angels, and is a sure word of
Prophecy, unto which it is good to take heed, and not unto old
wives fables of Apparitions and Goblins, such as Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> would
perswade us that they are tydings of another World, when we are
taught by unerring testimony of Truth, <em>That those that have Moses
and the Prophets, and do not hear them, neither will they be perswaded,
though one rose from the dead</em>. And therefore we must be
bold to tell Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, that the Sacred Scriptures do with infallible
certitude teach us, that both good and bad Spirits have most
certainly an Existence, and therefore we need none of his feigned
nor forged stories of Apparitions; which if they were certainly
known to be true and real, by undeceivable matters of fact, yet he
that doth not believe what is written of the Being of Spirits by
<em>Moses</em> and the Prophets, will not believe Apparitions, no not of a
man, if he came from the dead. And therefore I will conclude with
that precious and pithy Sentence of St. <em>Austin</em>, who saith: <i><span lang="la">Major
est hujus Scripturæ authoritas, quàm omnis humani ingenii perspicacitas</span></i>.
And believe not them that say, If you would know
the power of Devils and Witches, go to the Writings of Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>,
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, and to the rest of the Demonographers and Witchmongers,
that amass and heap together all the lying, vain improbable,
and impossible stories that can be scraped forth of any Author,
ancient, middle, or modern, when we are commanded to go
<em>to the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak not according to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>word, it is because there is no truth in them</em>. And so I shall shut up
this Chapter, wherein (I suppose) I have sufficiently proved, that
the denying of such a Witch as I have described, doth not infer
the denial of the Being of Angels or Spirits, and that Apparitions
are no sufficient grounds for Christians to believe the Existence of
Angels and Spirits by, but the Word of God; which was the thing
undertaken to be proved.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>As we have in the former Chapter proved, that Apparitions
(though true) are no sufficient warrant to ground our belief
upon, for the Existence of Angels or Spirits, but the Word of God:
so here we shall endeavour clearly to manifest, that the Sacred Scriptures
are the only Medium, joyned with sound Reason, of deciding
this point of the power and operation of Demons and Witches,
and not other improper Mediums brought in by divers Authors,
and first we shall answer the Objection of Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, that runs
thus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Object. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Pag.</em> 96, 97.</div>

<p class='c008'>“That though the New Testament had mentioned nothing of
this matter, yet its silence in such cases is not argumentative. He
said nothing of those large unknown Tracts of <em>America</em>, nor gave
he any intimations of as much as the existence of that numerous
people; much less did he leave instructions about their Conversion.
He gives no account of the affairs and state of the other
World, but only that general one of the happiness of some, and
the misery of others. He made no discovery of the <em>Magnalia</em> of
Art or Nature, no not of those whereby the propagation of the
Gospel might have been much advanced, <em>viz.</em> the Mystery of
Printing and the Magnet, and yet no one useth his silence in these
instances as an argument against the being of things, which are
evident objects of sense.” To which we answer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Respons.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. He falleth into a common mistake in making the Proposition
universal, and <i><span lang="la">dolus versatur in universalibus</span></i>, when it ought but
to be particular: so for him to say, that no silence of Scripture is
argumentative, is too universal; for its silence in point of Geography,
as in describing <em>America</em>, and the people thereof, nor in
discovering the <em>Magnalia Naturæ &#38; Artis</em> is not argumentative;
and we do not say, that all silence of Scripture is argumentative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>but yet we affirm that some silence of Scripture is argumentative.
So we cannot universally say, that nothing hath a being but what
is mentioned in Scripture; but we may very well affirm, that some
things have no being, or truth of existence, because not declared in
Scripture.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Lib.</em> 1. <em>c.</em> 1.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. The Scriptures were not written to teach Natural Philosophy,
Arts or Sciences, humane Policy, or the like; but were given,
<em>that the man of God might be perfect, furnished for every good work</em>:
and it is by them that we have the doctrine of eternal Salvation revealed
unto us, and we positively affirm the sufficiency of the Scriptures
unto Salvation, which thing no Orthodox Divine (we suppose)
will deny, and <em>Bellarmine</em> himself did confess in these words:
<i><span lang="la">Prophetici &#38; Apostolici libri sunt verum verbum Dei, ac stabilis regula
fidei</span></i>. And if it be a certain Rule of Faith, and the true Word
of God, then whatsoever it is silent of, we ought not to believe,
and so its silence is argumentative in that point. The Scriptures
are utterly silent concerning Purgatory, and therefore it is a good
argument to affirm there is no such place as Purgatory, because the
Word of God is silent as concerning it; but if it had been necessary
to have been believed, then there would have been mention
made of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. And as the Scriptures are sufficient in matters of Faith, and
<i><span lang="la">circa credenda</span></i>, and what they are silent in, are not to be received
as Articles of our Faith, but to be rejected, as having no truth of
Existence: So likewise what Worship God requireth of his people,
is fully revealed in his Word, and therefore I am to reject the
worshipping of <em>Mahomet</em> with the Turks, or Images, and praying
to Saints with the Papists, because I have neither precept nor president
in the Word, but it is silent in such matters; nay tells us, <em>That
he is the Lord our God, and him only we ought to serve</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Though Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> say, that God hath given no account of
the state of the other World, but only that general one of the happiness
of some, and the misery of others; yet Am I to believe as Mr.
<em>Glanvil</em> somewhere in his Book affirmeth, that <em>Samuels</em> Soul was
raised up by the Woman at <em>Endor</em>, and that those that he feigneth to
make Leagues and Contracts with Witches, are the Souls of such as
had been Witches when they lived, and asketh, Who saith that happy
Souls were never imployed in any ministeries here below? Or am
I to believe that both the Souls of the godly and wicked, do rove
up and down here upon earth, and make Apparitions, because the
Popish Teachers do hold it to be so? I hope not, and therefore I
shall in part give an answer here to some of these, and handle that
of the Woman of <em>Endor</em> in another place. 1. The Word of God
doth particularly teach us the state and condition of the Souls after
death, that they shall be like the Angels in Heaven; and all
other things necessary to move and draw us to believe the immortal
Existence of Souls, as that most able and learned Divine Dr.
<em>Stillingfleet</em> hath asserted in these words: “The Scriptures give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the most faithful representation of the state and condition of the
Soul of Man. The World (he saith) was almost lost in Disputes
concerning the Nature, Condition, and Immortality of the Soul,
before divine Revelation was made known to Mankind by the Gospel
of Christ; <em>but life and immortality was brought to light by the
Gospel</em>, and the future state of the soul of man not discovered in
an uncertain Platonical way, but with the greatest light and evidence
from that God who hath the supreme disposal of souls, and
therefore best knows and understands them.” A Sentence truly
pious and orthodoxal. 2. Hath not God in the holy Scriptures
amply and plainly taught us the state of the other World, in describing
unto us such a numerous company of Seraphims and Cherubims,
Angels and Archangels, with their several Orders, Offices,
Ministeries, and Imployments? and this is more than a general account,
as may be seen at full in that learned and godly Piece of Bishop
<em>Halls</em>, called <em>The invisible World</em>. And hath he not given us
a particular account of the very Kingdom of Darkness, telling us
of the Devil and his Angels, and precisely in this enumeration? <em>For
we wrestle not with flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places.</em> And this is more than a general
account, and we must needs say, that what he holds is very derogatory
to the wisdom and goodness of God, and the sufficiency
and truth of the Scriptures. 3. Must I believe him that the
souls of the Saints do rove and wander here below? when as Bishop
<em>Hall</em> saith, where he is speaking against the opinion of those
that hold, that Souls do sleep until the Day of Judgment: “Indeed
who can but wonder that any Christian can possibly give
entertainment to so absurd a thought, whilst he hears his Saviour
say, <em>Father I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with
me where I am, and that</em> (not in a safe sleep) <em>they may behold my
glory, which thou hast given me</em>.” Sure if the Souls departed be
with Christ where he is, and do behold his glory, then it is a Popish
Fable of Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, to feign their coming upon Messages
hither. The saying of St. <em>Bernard</em> is remarkable in this case: <i><span lang="la">Advertistis
tres esse sanctarum status animarum, primum videlicet in
corpore corruptibili, secundum sine corpore, tertium in corpore jam
glorificato. Primum in militia, secundum in requie, tertium in
beatitudine consummata.</span></i> And if the second state of holy Souls
be without a body, and be at peace and rest, then it must necessarily
be a truth, that they do not wander here, nor run upon Errands;
<em>For the souls of the righteous are in the hands of the Lord,
and there shall no torment touch them</em>. And our Saviour told the
Thief upon the Cross, <em>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise</em>,
that is, as Dr. <em>Hammond</em> giveth the Paraphrase: “Immediately after
thy death thou shalt go to a place of bliss, and there abide with
me, a Member of that my Kingdom which thou askest for.” Now
if the souls of the godly, after their death, be immediately in a place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of bliss, and abide with Christ as Members of his Kingdom, then
they do not wander up and down here, as Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> and the Papists
vainly fancy and believe; for as <em>Chrysostome</em> saith upon that
place of <em>Lazarus</em> his being carried by Angels into <em>Abrahams</em> bosome.
“What is it then that the Devils say, I am the Soul of such
a Monk? Truly I therefore believe it not, because the Devils say
it, for they deceive their Auditors.” 4. Or must I believe that the
souls of the wicked do wander, and make Apparitions here, because
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> and the Popish Writers tell me so? I hope not;
for the Text telleth us plainly, that the rich man presently after
his death was in Hell in torments, and could not come hither unto
earth again to warn his brethren, otherwise he would not have
prayed <em>Abraham</em> to have sent <em>Lazarus</em>. And whether it be taken
for a real History of things done, or but a Parable, yet the spiritual
meaning of our Saviour must be infallibly true, that immediately
after death the souls of the godly are by Angels carried into <em>Abrahams</em>
bosome, and the wicked go down into Hell, from whence
there is no redemption; and therefore do not wander up and down
here, nor make any Apparitions: for I imagine that the authority
of holy King <em>David</em>, a Prophet and a man after Gods own heart,
is to be preferred before the authority of a thousand Popish Writers,
and he tells us, when the child was dead: <em>But now he is dead,
wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to
him, but he shall not return to me.</em> And <em>Job</em> tells us: <em>As the cloud
is consumed, and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the
grave, shall come up no more, he shall return no more to his house,
neither shall his place know him any more</em>. And therefore it was a
vain argument of <em>Bellarmine</em> when he said: “<i><span lang="la">Apparitiones animarum
ex Purgatorio venientium idem testantur</span></i>.” To which the
Protestants answer: “But who shall bear witness of these Apparitions,
that they were not either feigned fables, or Satanical illusions?
They were men, and might be deceived, even the best of
them, with whom doth rest the faith of these Narrations.” 5. And
whereas he audaciously asketh, “Who saith that happy Souls were
never imployed in any Ministeries here below?” I shall tell him
who they are that say, that happy Souls departed are never imployed
here in any Ministeries; and they are all the learned Divines
of the Reformed Churches, and all those that were true Sons
of the Doctrine of the Church of <em>England</em>, such as were Bishop
<em>Jewel</em>, Bishop <em>Hall</em>, Dr. <em>Willet</em>, Dr. <em>Whitaker</em>, Mr. <em>Perkins</em>, and many
more such, the authority and reputation of the least of which is
far above the simple question of Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>. And therefore saith
the latter Confession of <em>Helvetia</em>: “Now that which is recorded
of the Spirits or Souls of the dead sometimes appearing to them
that are alive, &#38;c. we count those Apparitions among the delusions
and deceits of the Devil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>5. And as the Scriptures are sufficient both in respect of matters
of Faith, and concerning divine Worship, that their silence in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>two particulars are fully argumentative, to deny whatever is not
contained in them, as unfit to be received to either purpose. So in
respect of a Christians warfare, all things for the obtaining of a perfect
and compleat victory, and for standing and perseverance, are
in them fully declared, and what they mention not is to be rejected,
as wanting the seal of Divine Authority, whether it be in regard
of eschewing what is prohibited, or in following what is
commanded. And therefore we affirm, that what the Scriptures
have not revealed of the power of the Kingdom of Satan, is to be
rejected, and not to be believed, and what weapons we are to use
against the wiles of the Devil, we are to be furnished withal, but
have need of no others but what the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures
hath made known unto us, the rest are to be cast off, as fables and
lyes, or humane inventions, because the Scriptures are silent of any
such matter, and that for these weighty grounds and considerations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Doctrin. Christian.</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>1. We shall take the Concession of <em>Bellarmine</em> himself, who
saith: <i><span lang="la">Nullum est vitium ad quod sanandum non invenitur in Scriptura
aliquod remedium</span></i>. And again: <i><span lang="la">Illa quæ sunt simpliciter
omnibus necessaria, Apostoli consueverunt omnibus prædicare: &#38;
aliorum quæ sunt omnibus utilia</span></i>. And to the same purpose is the
saying of St. <em>Austin</em>: <i><span lang="la">Titubat fides, si divinarum Scripturarum vacillet
authoritas: porrò fide titubante, etiam ipsa charitas languescit</span></i>.
Therefore if there be no fault for which the Scripture doth
not yield some remedy, then surely to make a visible League with
the Devil, or to have carnal Copulation with him, either must have
no verity at all in it, or that the Scripture hath provided no remedy
for it, for of such things there is no mention. And if Faith
must stumble, where the authority of the Scriptures is wanting, then
surely the belief of all rational men must needs be staggering, to
believe what these common Witchmongers affirm of the Witches
visible League and carnal Copulation with the Devil, when there
is no authority of Scripture at all to strengthen or countenance
any such matter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Eph. 6. 11, 12, 13.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Pet. 5. 8, 9.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. The Scriptures do fully and abundantly inform us of the Devils
spiritual and invisible power, and against the same declares unto
us the whole Armor of God, with which we ought to be furnished,
as the Apostle saith: <em>Put on the whole armor of God, that
ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle
not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the
whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil
day, and having done all, to stand.</em> And the Apostle St. <em>Peter</em>
telleth us: <em>Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil,
like a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour;
whom resist stedfast in the faith</em>. And in another place: <em>For the
weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations, and
every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of God</em>.
From which Scriptures we may take these remarkable observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Cor. 2. 11.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Tim. 3. 7.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Tim. 2. 26.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. We are to consider the nature of this Warfare, that it is spiritual
and against spiritual wickedness in high places, and not against
flesh and blood; and the Holy Ghost could not be wanting
nor defective, but superabundantly full in describing the nature of
this warfare, that it is spiritual, not carnal; and therefore we are
to prepare our selves against all spiritual assaults: but as for any
visible, carnal, or bodily, there is not, nor can be any such, because
the Apostle that declared by his Preaching and Writings the whole
counsel of God, hath revealed no such thing as the visible appearing
of Satan, much less of his making of a visible League with the
Witches, or the sucking of their bodies, or the having carnal Copulation
with them, which must of necessity be lyes and figments,
because the Holy Ghost hath not warned us of any such, which we
ought certainly to believe he would have done, if there had been
any such matter. And the holy Apostle, who was not ignorant of
the devices <span lang="grc">νοήματα</span>, notions or intentions of Satan, would not have
omitted to have warned the godly, if there had been any such
matter as a visible League, sucking of their bodies, or carnal Copulation,
the thing being of so great weight and concern. For
as one said well: <i><span lang="la">Grave est de vita &#38; bonis periclitari, sed multò
gravius insidiantem habere Satanam</span></i>. And he that so often hath
given us warning of the wiles, devices, and snares of the Devil, if
there had been any such dangerous snare as this, would without
doubt have given us notice of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. We are to consider the end of this Warfare, that it is for no
less than a Crown, and that not a terrestrial, but a celestial one, not
a fading one, but an everlasting one, a Crown of eternal life, of immortal
glory, even for an house given of God, eternal in the Heavens.
Therefore this being a thing of the greatest concern that
belongs to a Christian, the Apostle would not doubtlesly omit any
thing that had been necessary to the obtaining of such an inestimable
prize, and such an important Victory; and therefore cannot in
reason have concealed or omitted such a weighty matter as a visible
League, and the like, if there had been any such thing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Eph. 6. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. We are to consider that this Armor prescribed for the Souldiers
of Jesus Christ, is <em>the whole armor of God</em>, <span lang="grc">πανοπλίαν</span>, the compleat
armor of God (as Dr. <em>Hammond</em> renders it) perfect both for
defence and offence. And therefore the Apostle describes it fully
by a Metaphor, taken from such Arms as the <em>Roman</em> or other Nations
in his time use, saying: <em>Stand therefore, having your
loyns girt about with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness:
And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
peace. Above all taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and
watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
Saints.</em> And as it is a compleat and perfect Armor, both in respect
of defence and offence; so it is a spiritual, not a carnal, corporeal,
or bodily armor, because the warfare <em>is not against flesh and blood,
but against spiritual wickedness in high places</em>, against spiritual enemies,
not against corporeal and carnal ones; for as the enemies are
and the warfare, so are the armor and weapons. From whence we
truly urge, that the Apostle led by the Holy Ghost, and the Wisdom
of the Father, and knowing the whole counsel of God (especially
in this point) hath omitted nothing that is fitting armor for
a Christian either of defence or offence, whereby he may be inabled
to get the victory against Satan, and all his spiritual Army.
And therefore that either Satan hath not power, or doth not assault
Christians after a visible, carnal, and bodily manner, or else that
the Holy Ghost hath been defective in prescribing armor against
such assaults, and consequently that the armor of a Souldier of Jesus
Christ is not compleat, or else there is no such bodily assaults
of Satan at all, as to tempt visibly, to make a corporeal League, to
suck upon the Witches bodies, nor to have carnal Copulation with
them. But we affirm, and that (as we conceive) with sound reason,
that the Scriptures in this particular of a Christians armor, and
the compleatness of it, is abundantly sufficient against all spiritual
assaults whatsoever, and consequently that there is no other kind
of assaults but meerly spiritual, and therefore the Word of God,
the most proper <em>Medium</em> with sound reason, to judge of the power
of Spirits and Devils by.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Gregor. sup. Ezekiel.</em> <em>Homil.</em> 6.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Tim. 1. 17.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Heb. 12. 9.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. That the Scriptures and sound reason are the only true and
proper <em>Medium</em> to decide these Controversies by, is most undeniably
apparent, because God is a Spirit, and the invisible God, and
therefore best knows the nature and power of the spiritual and invisible
World, and being the God of truth, can and doth inform us
of their power and operations, better than the vain lyes and figments
of the Heathen Poets, or the dreams of the Platonick School,
either elder or later, nay better than all the notional and groundless
speculations of the Schoolmen, of whom it may truly be said
that, <i><span lang="la">Rivulo divinæ Scripturæ relicto, in abyssos vanarum opinionum
incidêrunt</span></i>. Nay these can better inform us in this point,
than the Writings of all Mortals besides, and therefore whatsoever
may be said to the contrary, may receive its answer from the Father:
<i><span lang="la">Quod de Scripturis sacris authoritatem non habet, eâdem facilitate
contemnitur, quâ probatur</span></i>. Therefore he being <em>the King
eternal, immortal, invisible, and the only wise God</em>, of none can we
so truly and certainly learn these things, as of him who hath
plentifully taught us in his Word all things necessary to Salvation,
<em>that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished to every
good work</em>. Nay <em>he is the Father of Spirits</em>, and therefore truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>knoweth, and can and doth teach us their Natures, Offices, and
Operations.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The Scriptures (especially the Writings of <em>Moses</em>) considered
only as Historical, are of more antiquity, verity, and certainty both
as to Doctrine, Precepts, matters of Fact, and Chronology, than
all other Histories whatsoever, whether of the Phenicians, Egyptians,
Chaldeans, or Grecians, as the learned person Dr. <em>Stillingfleet</em>
hath sufficiently proved. Now if there had been such an one as a
Witch, that made a visible League with the Devil, and upon whose
body he suckt, and with whom he had carnal Copulation, something
of that nature would doubtless have been recorded in the
Scriptures, of which notwithstanding there is not the least tittle or
mention. And <em>Moses</em> who was so perfect a Law-giver, as in a manner
to omit no kind or sort of sin or evil that men possibly could
commit, but to forbid it, and make a Law against it, could never
have left out such an horrid, unnatural, and hellish wickedness as
carnal Copulation with the fallen Angels, if there had been any
such matter. For he saith, after he had forbidden all sorts of Fornications,
Adulteries, and Incests: <em>Thou shalt not lye with mankind,
as with womankind: it is abomination. Neither shalt thou lye with
any beast to defile thy self therewith: neither shall any woman stand
before a beast to lye down thereto: it is confusion. Defile not your selves
in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled, which
I cast out before you.</em> Now it cannot be rationally imagined, that
<em>Moses</em> having named and prohibited the less sins of bestial Copulation
and Sodomy, would have left out that which is the most
horrid and execrable of all others, to wit, carnal Copulation with
Devils, if there had been any such thing either in possibility or act.
And therefore we may conclude according to the rules of sound
reason, that there is no such matter, and that the Scriptures are the
most fit <em>Medium</em> to decide these Controversies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Thess. 3. 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. The Scriptures and sound reason are the most fit Mediums to
determine these things by, because there is nothing that any hath
written upon this Subject (though the Authors be superfluously
numerous) but if it agree not with the principles of right reason,
and the rules of the Scriptures, they ought to be rejected. For
what is not consonant to right reason, ought not to be received by
any that truly are rational Creatures; and what agrees not with the
Word of God, ought not to be entertained by any that are or would
be accounted good or true Christians. And if all the gross fables,
lyes, impossibilities, and nonsensical stories that Demonographers
and Witchmongers have related and accumulated together, were
brought to the test of the Scriptures and sound reason, they would
soon be hissed off the Stage, and find few believers or embracers of
them. But alas! all (nay few men) have the right use and exercise
of their rational faculty, but men to see to are in themselves as
beasts; and therefore we may all pray with the Apostle to be delivered
from unreasonable men, or men without reason, or absurd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>men, that make no right use of reason, <span lang="grc">ἀτόπων ἀνθρώπων</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ut supr.</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>6. The Scriptures and right reason have declared all things concerning
Spirits either good or bad, as also all sorts of Diviners (or
Witches, if you will have them called so) and the nature, power,
operations, and actions of them, more than any other Book that
was written before the time of our Saviours Birth (the dreams and
whimsies of the Platonists only excepted) or for the space of three
hundred years after, and therefore are the most fit Medium and
Authority to determine these things by. 1. For first it is manifest,
that all things are ordered by the wisdom of the Almighty,
who hath done whatsoever he would both in Heaven, <em>and he doth
according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants
of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
What dost thou?</em> And these things God doth not by a naked prescience,
but by his divine will, providence, and ordination, as a
learned Divine hath taught us in these words: <i><span lang="la">Est hoc inprimis
necessarium &#38; salutare Christiano nôsse, quòd Deus nihil præscit
contingenter, sed quòd omnia incommutabili &#38; æternâ, infallibilíq;
voluntate &#38; providet, &#38; præponit, &#38; facit</span></i>. So it was only his
will, decree, and determination, that Christ should not be born, or
assume humane nature visibly, but at that precise time that he had
appointed, according to the evidence of the Apostle. <em>But when the
fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman,
made under the law.</em> And when that fulness of time was come that
he sent him, then did the divine Wisdom and Providence ordain all
means, objects and occasions, whereby the fulness of the Godhead
that dwelt in him bodily, might be made manifest, by working of
miracles, both by himself and his Apostles, therefore were there so
many several sorts of Demoniacks, blind, lame, dumb, deaf, and diseased,
not by chance, but by the providence of the Father, and only
and chiefly that the work of God might be manifest in them, for
the Evangelist tells us: <em>And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which
was blind from his birth. And his Disciples asked him, saying,
Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but
that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</em> Upon
which place Dr. <em>Hammond</em> doth give this clear Paraphrase: “And
some of his followers asked him, saying, Sir, was it any sin of his
own, when his soul was in another body, or was it some sin of his
parents at the time of his conception, which caused this blindness
in him? Neither his own, nor his parents sins were the cause
of this blindness of his, but Gods secret wisdom, who meant by
this means to shew forth in me his miraculous power among you.”
And though the Doctor would bring in the opinion of <em>Pythagoras</em>
of the Transmigration of Souls (of which vain traditional fancies
he is almost every where guilty) as received and imbibed in by
some of the Jews that then followed him: yet it appeareth plainly,
that it was not interrogated by the Jews, but by his Disciples,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><span lang="grc">ὁι Μαθηλαὶ</span>, and therefore it is a wonder the Doctor should be so
grosly mistaken; and <em>Theophylact</em> tells us thus much plainly: <i><span lang="la">Neq;
enim Apostoli Gentiles nugas receperunt, quo anima ante corpus in
alio mundo versans peccet, ac deinde pœnam quandam recipiat in
corpus descendens. Piscatores cùm essent, neq; audiverant tale quiddam,
quia hæc Philosophorum dogmata erant.</span></i> And so declareth,
that the Disciples having seen Christ heal the man that had thirty
eight years been impotent and lame, and had said unto him, <em>Behold
thou art made whole, sin no more lest a worse thing come unto
thee</em>, did conceive, that this man being born blind, it had been a
punishment upon him, either for his own sins, or the sins of his parents,
and so doubting asked the question. And so also do St. <em>Austin</em>
and <em>Chrysostome</em> expound the place, which is both sound and
rational. And of our Saviours responsion, <em>That neither had this
man sinned, nor his parents</em>, the learned Father giveth a satisfactory
answer, saying: <i><span lang="la">Nunquid vel ipse sine originali peccato natus erat,
vel vivendo nihil addiderat? Habebant ergo peccatum, &#38; ipse &#38;
parentes ejus, sed non ipso peccato factum est ut cæcus nasceretur.
Ipse autem causam dicit quare cæcus sit natus, cùm subdit: sed ut
manifestentur opera Dei in illo.</span></i> And to the same purpose <em>Gregory</em>
hath this notable passage: <i><span lang="la">Alia itaq; est percussio, quâ peccator
percutitur, ut sine retractatione puniatur: Alia quâ peccator percutitur,
ut corrigatur: Alia quâ quisq; percutitur, non ut præterita
corrigat, sed ne ventura committat: Alia per quam nec præterita
culpa corrigitur, nec futura prohibetur. Sed dum inopinata salus
percussionem sequitur, salvantis virtus cognita ardentiùs amatur.</span></i>
From whence it is manifest, that as the Father in the fulness of time,
by his Decree and Providence sent out the Son, <i><span lang="la">in whom dwelt
the fulness of the Godhead bodily</span></i>, with a purpose to manifest the
same by his great and wonderful Miracles: so in his divine Wisdom
he had ordered fit subjects and objects upon whom that power
might be made manifest. And therefore were there such strange
diseases offered, especially in Demoniacks, that can hardly be parallel’d
in any one Country of that small compass, and in so short
a time, and all that the works of God might be manifest by that
ever-blessed Saviour of Mankind, Jesus Christ. And though there
were so many persons, so many several ways perplexed and afflicted
both in their minds and bodies, as some made deaf and dumb,
some torn and contorted in their members, some thrown on the
ground, some into the fire, some driven to live amongst the graves
and monuments, and yet all these cured by our blessed Saviour: Yet
is there no mention made of any that had made a visible League
with the Devil, nor upon whose bodies he suckt, nor with whom
he had carnal Copulation, nor whom he had transubstantiated into
Wolves, Dogs, Hares, Cats, or Squirrels; to have cured which
would have been as great a miracle as any of the rest, but there
were no such matters; and therefore we may safely conclude, there
never were, are, or can be any such matters, whatsoever may be
said to the contrary.</p>

of deceiving Impostors, Diviners, or Witches, who were all discovered
and conquered by that power that Christ had given unto
the Apostles; as for instance: <em>Simon, which before-time in the
same city used sorcery, and bewitched</em> <span lang="grc">μαγεύων κὶ ἐξισῶν</span> <em>the people of
Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one. To whom they
gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great
power of God. And to him they had regard, because that of long
time he had bewitched them with sorceries</em>; <span lang="grc">τῶς μαγείαις ἐξεσακέναι αὐτὺς</span>,
<i><span lang="la">seducebat populum suis magicis præstigiis</span></i>, saith <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>; and
<em>Beza</em>, <i><span lang="la">Exercuerat artem magicam, &#38; gentem Samariæ obstupefecerat</span></i>;
who when he would have bought the gift of the Holy Ghost
with money, was rejected by <em>Peter</em> as an Impostor and Counterfeit,
and declared, <em>that he was in the gall of bitterness</em>. Such another
was <em>Elymas</em> the Sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
<span lang="grc">ὁ μάγος</span> who was stricken blind by St. <em>Paul</em>. Such an one was the
Damsel that was possessed with a Spirit of Divination, which St.
<em>Paul</em> cast forth. And such were the Jewish Exorcists, that took
upon them to call over them which had evil Spirits, the Name of
the Lord Jesus, saying, <em>We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
But the man in whom the evil spirit was, leapt on them, and overcame
them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that
house naked and wounded.</em> But amongst these several sorts of Diviners,
Impostors, or Witches, there were none that had made a
visible League with the Devil, nor upon whose bodies he suckt,
nor that had carnal Copulation with him, nor were changed into
Cats, Dogs, or Wolves: but if the Devil had had any such power,
or had there been any such sort of Witches, the divine Wisdom and
Providence would have ordained some of them then to have been
made apparent, that his power by Christ and the Apostles, might
have been shewed as well in the greater as in the less: and that for
the more full manifestation of the Works of God, as for a more
triumphant declaration of the power of Christ in conquering him
and his Kingdom, and for a more ample warning and instruction to
the Children of God to avoid the snares and wiles of the Devil;
but there being no such, then we must rationally conclude, that
there now is not, nor ever was, or can be any such matter, but the
vain believing of such figments and forgeries, is only the cunning
and delusion of Satan, who works by lying and deceiving wonders
<span lang="grc">τέρασι ψεύδοις</span>, of which St. <em>Chrysostome</em> saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Hoc est, omnem
ostentabit potentiam, sed nihil veri, verùm omnia ad seductionem.
Et prodigiis, inquit, mendacii. Aut ementitis ac ludificantibus, aut
ad mendacium inducentibus.</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>Having now sufficiently proved, that the Scriptures and sound
Reason are the proper Mediums to decide these difficulties by, we
shall in the next place shew the invalidity of some ways used by
the most Authors, to prove and defend these Tenents, and <i><span lang="la">ab uno
disce omnes</span></i>, take Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> for all, in his own words: “That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>this being matter of fact, is only capable of the evidence of authority
and sense: and by both these, the being of Witches and
Diabolical Contracts, is most abundantly confirmed.” To which
we shall give this smart Reply. Not to make the Proposition universal,
generally to deny the evidence of authority and sense; no, far
be it from me to run into that wild and senseless absurdity, which
were in a manner to destroy the credibility of all humane testimony:
But we shall here speak of the evidence of authority and sense with
this restriction and limitation, to these Particulars. 1. Those Authors
that write of Apparitions and Spirits. 2. Those that treat
of Diabolical Leagues and Contracts. 3. Those that mention the
Devil sucking of the Witches body, carnal Copulation with them,
their being changed into Hares, Dogs, Cats, and Wolves, and the
like. These Authors we say are to be read with caution, and their
relations not to be credited, except better proof be given to evidence
the matters of fact, than hitherto hath been brought by any,
and that for these especial reasons and necessary cautions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Plutarch. in vit. Marc. Brut.</em> <em>pag.</em> 361.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. The Authors that have recorded stories of this nature, are to
be seriously considered, whether they have related the matter of
fact by their own proper knowledge, as eye and ear-witnesses of it,
or have taken it up by hear-say, common fame, or the relation of
others: and if what they relate, were not of their own certain
knowledge or <span lang="grc">αὐτοψία</span>, then is it of little or no credit at all; for the
other that relates it, might be guilty either of active or passive deception
and delusion, or might have heard it from another, or by
common report: of all which there is no certainty, but leaveth
sufficient grounds for dubitation, and is sufficient to caution a prudent
person altogether to suspend his assent, until better proof can
be brought. There is a story related by <em>Plinius Cæcilius</em> to his
friend <em>Sura</em>, of a House in <em>Athens</em> that was haunted by a Spirit in
so terrible and frightful a manner, that it was left utterly forsaken,
and none would inhabit in it, until that <em>Athenodorus</em> the Philosopher
adventured upon it, and abode the coming of the Apparition
or Phantasm, and upon its signs followed it to a place below, and
then it vanished: he marked the place, and went to the Magistrate,
and caused the place to be digged up, and found the bones of a
person inchained or fettered, and caused the bones to be buried,
and so the House remained free afterwards. It is a wonder to think
how many Authors have swallowed this relation (nay even <em>Philip
Camerarius</em> himself, who though a very Learned man, yet in things
of this nature too extremely credulous) and urged it for proof, as
a matter of great credit and authority, when we cannot discern
that it affords any credible ground to a rational man to believe it,
not only because the very matter it self, and the circumstances of
it, do yield sufficient grounds of the suspicion of its verity; but
chiefly because <em>Pliny</em> doth but relate it by hear-say, <i><span lang="la">exponam ut
accepi</span></i>, and of it and the rest he desires the opinion of his Friend
<em>Sura</em>, from whom we do not find any answer. The story taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>from <em>Plutarch</em> (a grave Author, if he be considered as an Heathen
and a Moralist) yet of no authority to decide such points as these
are of the voice that called upon <em>Thamus</em>, and commanded him to
declare when he came at <em>Palodes</em>, that the great God <em>Pan</em> was dead,
which he performed, and that thereupon followed a great lamentation
of many: the story at large is related by many, and urged
as a matter of great weight and credibility, when indeed there is
no ground sufficient to perswade any that it was true. For if it
had been related by <em>Plutarch</em> as an ear-witness of it, yet was he
but an Heathen, that we know believed many fond, lying, and impossible
things, especially of their Gods; and therefore in this
case to a considerate Christian could be of no great authority.
And if his authority had been great, or of weight in such matters
as these, yet was he but <i><span lang="la">singularis testis</span></i>, which is not sufficient in
these things to be relied upon. And lastly (to our present purpose
here) he doth not record it as a thing of his own certain
knowledge, but of hear-say from <em>Epitherses</em>, who was but a single
Relator, and a man of no certain veracity; and therefore we can
have no rational ground to believe the truth of the story, but it
may be rejected with more reason, than it can be affirmed by. Of
no greater credit can his story be of <em>Brutus</em> his <em>malus Genius</em> appearing
unto him, because he received this by meer Tradition and
hear-say, neither could it have any other rise, but from the relation
of <em>Brutus</em> himself, whose guilty confidence, and troubled
brain, fancied such vain things; for those that were near <em>Brutus</em>
neither saw nor heard any such matter, and therefore must have
been a deception of Phansie, and no real Apparition <i><span lang="la">ad extra</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>p.</em> 284.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. And as evidence of the matter of fact recorded from the relation
of others, is of no validity to a judicious person: so if the
matter of fact be witnessed but by one single testimony (though
an eye or an ear-witness) it is not sufficient, because one single person
may be imperfect in some senses, or under some distemper, and so
be no proper Judge of what it sees or hears; and the Word of Truth
tells us, <em>That in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
shall be established</em>; and therefore we are not (especially in such
abstruse matters as these) to trust the evidence of one single testimony.
To make clear this Particular, we shall relate a story or
two from the credit of the Reverend and Learned Bishop <em>Hall</em>,
joyned with his judgment of such weak and feigned Tales, one of
which runs thus: “<cite><span lang="la">Johannes à Jesu Maria</span></cite>, a modern Carmelite,
writing the Life of <cite>Theresia</cite> (Sainted lately by <em>Gregory</em> XV.) tells
us, that as she was a vigilant Overseer of her Votaries in her life,
so in and after death she would not be drawn away from her care
and attendance: For (saith he) if any of her Sisters did but talk in
the set hours of their silence, she was wont by three knocks at the
door of the Cell, to put them in mind of their enjoyned taciturnity.
And on a time appearing (as she did often) in a lightsome
brightness to a certain Carmelite, is said thus to bespeak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>him; <i><span lang="la">Nos cœlestes, ac vos exules amore ac puritate fœderati esse
debemus, &#38;c.</span></i> We Citizens of Heaven, and ye exiled Pilgrims on
earth, ought to be linked in a League of love and purity, &#38;c.
Methinks the Reporter (saith the Bishop) should fear this to be
too much good fellowship for a Saint; I am sure neither Divine
nor Ancient story had wont to afford such familiarity: and many
have misdoubted the agency of worse, where have appeared less
causes of suspicion. That this was (if any thing) an ill Spirit
under that face, I am justly confident; neither can any man
doubt, that looking further into the relation, finds him to come
with a lye in his mouth. For thus he goes on; [We Celestial
ones behold the Deity, ye banished ones worship the Eucharist,
which ye ought to worship with the same affection wherewith
we adore the Deity] such perfume doth this holy Devil leave
behind him. The like might be instanced in a thousand Apparitions
of this kind, all worthy of the same entertainment.” This
is a story from one single person, a lying Carmelite, one that for
interest, and upholding of Superstition and Idolatry, had feigned
and forged it; for in it self it appeareth to be a meer falsity and
figment, as any rational man may easily discern, and so are a thousand
stories of this kind worthy of the like entertainment, that is,
to be condemned for most horrid lyes. Another he tells us: “Amongst
such fastidious choice of whole dry-fats of voluminous
relations, I cannot forbear to single out that one famous of <em>Magdalen
de la Croix</em>, in the year of our Lord Christ 1545, &#38;c.” The
third from the mouth of another lying Fryar named <i><span lang="la">Jacobus de
Pozali</span></i>, in his Sermon, “That St. <em>Macarius</em> once went about to
make peace betwixt God and Satan, &#38;c.” Now whatsoever credit
this Learned man (who in things of this kind appeareth to be
as vainly credulous as any) doth seem to give unto these, or what
use soever he would make of them, it is undeniably manifest to all
impartial judgments, that they were but absolute forgeries and
knacks of Imposture and Knavery, and (according to his own opinion)
may justly be ranked amongst those thousand Apparitions of
this kind, all worthy of the same entertainment, that is, to be rejected
for abominable lyes or forgeries, and that for these reasons.
1. Because they are not attested by any sincere and uncorrupt ear
and eye-witnesses, but by reports and relations, and that of those
that were corrupt and partial, or Accomplices to bring to pass the
fraud and imposture. 2. If they be run up to their first Author or
Venter of the Tale, he will but be found a single Witness, which is
utterly insufficient in evidencing truly a matter of fact. 3. The
Relaters of them did publish them for interest sake, and upon design
to advance false Doctrine, Worship, Superstition, and Idolatry,
and therefore are not of validity and credit. 4. In themselves (if
strictly considered) they will appear to be lying, ridiculous, contradictory
in themselves, and contrary to the authority of Divine
Writ, and dissonant to sound and right reason, and therefore ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>to have no other entertainment, but as abominable lyes and forgeries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Of Credul. and Incredul. pag. 159.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>A serious Disswasive from Popery, pag. 38, 39.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. But if matters of fact be witnessed and attested by many or
divers persons that were ear and eye-witnesses, yet may their testimony
bear no weight in the balance of Justice or right Reason,
because they may be corrupt in point of interest, and so have their
judgments mis-guided and biassed by the corruption of their desires
and affections, or relate things out of spleen, envy, and malice;
and so may not in these mysterious matters be fit authority to rely
upon, nor competent evidence in these particulars, as Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>
is forced to confess in these words: “In the relation of strange
things, whether natural or supernatural, to know the temper of
the Relator, if it can be known: and what interest he had, or
might probably be supposed to have had, in the relation, to have
it believed. And again, whether he profess to have seen it himself,
or taken it upon the credit of others. And whether a man
by his profession in a capacity probable to judge of the truth of
those things, to which he doth bear witness.” Every one of these
particulars would require a particular consideration. For if there
be interest in point of Religion, then all authorities, all colour of
reason is drawn in to make good this interest, and verity is commonly
stifled in this contest for selfness and interest, and the adverse
parties stigmatized with all the filthy lyes and enormous
crimes that can be invented, as is most manifest in these instances.
The Popish party finding themselves hindred and opposed in point
of the highest interest, have forged a thousand false stories and
tales to make good the interest of their Party, and have left no dirt
and dung unscraped up to throw in the faces of their Opponents;
and so have each Party done against other, where religious interest
was the quarrel, as Bishop <em>Hall</em> hath truly observed in this
passage, where he is shewing the abominable corruptions of the
Church of <em>Rome</em>: “A Religion that cares not by what wilful falshoods
it maintains a part; as <em>Wickliffs</em> blasphemy, <em>Luthers</em> advice
from the Devil, <em>Tindals</em> Community, <em>Calvins</em> feigned Miracle,
and blasphemous death, <em>Bucers</em> neck broken, <em>Beza</em>’s Revolt,
the blasting of Huguenots, <em>Englands</em> want of Churches, and
Christendom, Queen <em>Elizabeths</em> unwomanliness, her Episcopal
Jurisdiction, her secret fruitfulness, English Catholicks cast in
Bears skins to Dogs, <em>Plesses</em> shameful overthrow, <em>Garnats</em> straw,
the <em>Lutherans</em> obscene Night-Revels, <em>Scories</em> drunken Ordination
in a Tavern, the Edict of our gracious King <em>James</em> (<em>An.</em> 87.)
for the establishment of Popery, our casting the crusts of our Sacrament
to Dogs, and ten thousand of this nature, maliciously
raised against knowledge and conscience, for the disgrace of those
whom they would have hated, e’re known.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The rise of this opinion that we are disputing against, that the
Devil makes a visible and corporeal League with the Witches,
that he sucks upon their bodies, hath carnal Copulation with them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and that they are changed into Hares, Dogs, Cats, or Wolves, and
the like, was soon after the thirteenth hundred year of Christ,
when as <em>Frederick</em> the Second had made a Law temporal, for the
burning of Hereticks. And not long after that, was the Inquisition
set up in <em>Rome</em> and <em>Spain</em>, and then did the Inquisitors and their
Adherents, draw in from the Heathen Poets, and all other Authors,
whatsoever might carry any colour of authority or reason,
the better to countenance their bloody and unjust proceedings,
where they drew thousands of people into the snare of the Inquisition
for pretended Witchcraft, which they made to be Heresie.
And whatsoever these have written concerning these things, such as
<em>Delrio</em>, <em>Bodinus</em>, <em>Remigius</em>, <em>Springerus</em>, <em>Niderus</em>, <em>Spineus</em>, <em>Grillandus</em>,
and a whole rabble besides not necessary to be named, are nothing
but lyes and forgeries, and deserve no credit at all for these
reasons. 1. Because as many of them as either were Inquisitors
themselves, or those that had any dependence upon them, or received
benefit by their proceedings, are all unjust and corrupt Authors
and Witnesses, as writing and bearing witness for their own
ends, interest, and profit, having a share in the Goods and Estates of
all that were convicted and condemned: and the Wolf and Raven
will be sure to give judgment on the Serpents side, that he may
devour the man, though never so innocent, because they hope to
have a share of his flesh, or at least to pick the bones. 2. These
Authors that were the first Broachers of these monstrous stories of
Apparitions and Witches, and are so frequently quoted by others,
(that ought to have been more wary, and might have seen reason
enough to have rejected all their feigned lyes and delusions) were
not only sharers in the spoil of the Goods of the condemned (who
were judged <i><span lang="la">per fas &#38; nefas</span></i>) but also had another base end and
interest, to wit, to advance the opinion of Purgatory, praying for
the dead, setting up the vain Superstitions of the virtue of the sign
of the Cross, holy Water, and the like. And therefore they did
forge so many stories of Apparitions, and Souls coming forth of
Purgatory, and recorded so many false, lying, and impossible things
from the forced, extorted, and pretended confessions of the Witches
themselves, which were nothing else but an Hotch-potch of horrid
and abominable lyes, not to be credited, because the Authors only
invented them, to promote their own base ends and wretched interests.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Anim. mag.</em> <em>præf.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>Again, where Authors are engaged for interest sake, they fall into
heat, passion, malice, and envy, and what they cannot make out
by strength of arguments, they labour to make good by lyes and
scandals, as is most apparent in this one Example we shall here give.
<em>Henricus Cornelius Agrippa</em>, a person in his time well known to
most of the Learned in <em>Europe</em>, and admired for his general and universal
skill in all kind of Learning, having published a Piece which
he styled, <em>A Declaration of the incertitude and vanity of Sciences
and Arts, and the excellency of the Word of God</em>: wherein amongst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>other things he had sharply taxed the Monks and Fryars, and other
Orders, of their ignorance, idleness, and many other crimes and misdemeanors,
whereby certain Theologasters of <em>Lovain</em> (netled with
their own guilt) did in bitter malice draw up certain Articles
against him, therein accusing him of Errour, Impiety, and Heresie,
and had so far incensed <em>Charles</em> the Fifth then Emperour against
him, that he had commanded <em>Agrippa</em> unheard to make a Recantation.
But he writing a strong, polite, and pithy Apology, gave
them such a responsion, that afterwards they did never reply; by
which, and the mediation of divers learned Friends, who gave <em>Cæsar</em>
a right information of the end and drift of that Book, and of
the things therein contained, He was pacified, and brought to a
better understanding of the matter. Yet this could not protect
<em>Agrippa</em> from the virulent malice of the Popish Witchmongers, but
that they forged most abominable lyes and scandals against him,
especially that wretched and ignorant Monk <em>Paulus Jovius</em>, that
was not ashamed to record in his Book intituled, <i><span lang="la">De Elogiis doctorum
Virorum</span></i>, that <em>Agrippa</em> carried a Cacodemon about with him,
in the likeness of a black Dog, and that he died at <em>Lyons</em>, when it
is certain he died at <em>Gratianople</em>. From all which horrid aspersions
and lying scandals he is sufficiently acquitted by the famous
Physician <em>Johannes Wierus</em>, one that was educated under him, and
lived familiarly with him; and therefore was best able to testifie
the whole truth of these particulars. But any that are so perversly
and wilfully blinded as to have a sinister opinion of this person,
(who <i><span lang="la">ab ineunte ætate in literis educatus esset, quâ fuit ingenii fælicitate,
in omni artium ac disciplinarum genere ita versatus est, ut
excelluerit</span></i>) may have most ample satisfaction from the modest and
impartial Pen of <em>Melchior Adams</em>, who hath written his Life: as
also from something that our Countryman, who called himself
<em>Eugenius Philalethes</em>, hath clearly delivered: so that none can be
ignorant of this particular, but such as wilfully refuse to be informed
of the truth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. vit. Germ. medic.</em> <em>pag.</em> 29.</div>

<p class='c008'>Nay where interest hath a share, truth can hardly be expected,
though it be but in more trivial things, as even but for aery fame
and vain-glory, as may be manifest in <em>Hierome Cardan</em>, who was a
man of prodigious pride and vain-glory, which led him (as the
learned Dr. <em>Brown</em> hath noted) into no small errours, being a great
Amasser of strange and incredible stories, led to relate them by his
meer ambition of hunting after fame and the reputation of an universal
Scholar. And of no less pride and vain-glorious ambition
was his Antagonist <em>Julius Cæsar Scaliger</em> guilty, of whom it may
truly be said, that he was of the nature of those of the <em>Ottoman</em> Family,
that do not think they can ever raign safely, unless they
strangle all their Brethren; so he did not think that he could aspire
to the Throne of being the Monarch of general Learning, without
stifling the fame and reputation of <em>Cardan</em> and others, against
whom he hath been most fell, and impetuously bitter. But when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>men fall out about professional interest, then the stories that through
malice they invent and forge one against another, are incredible,
as is manifest in many Examples; but we shall but give one for
all, which is this. When <em>Paracelsus</em>, returning from his Peregrination
of ten years and above, was called to be Physical Lecturer
at <em>Basil</em>, where he continued three years, and more, having by his
strange and wonderful Cures drawn the most part of <em>Germany</em>, and
the adjacent Countries into admiration; so that he was, and might
(notwithstanding the envy and ignorance of all his enemies) justly
be styled, <i><span lang="la">Totius Germaniæ decus &#38; gloria</span></i>: yet this was not sufficient
to quiet the violent and virulent mind of <em>Thomas Erastus</em>,
who coming to be setled at <em>Basil</em>, and finding that he could not
outgo nor equal <em>Paracelsus</em> in point of Medicinal Practice, and
being strongly grounded in the Aristotelian Philosophy, and the
Galenical Physick, did with all poyson and bitterness labour to
confute the Principles of Chymical Physick that <em>Paracelsus</em> had introduced;
and lest his arguments might be too weak, he backt
them with most horrible lyes and scandals, thinking that many
and strong accusations (though never so false) would not be easily
answered, nor totally washt off: which after were greedily swallowed
down by <em>Libanius</em>, <em>Conringius</em>, <em>Sennertus</em>, and many others:
so apt are men to invent, and suck in scandals against others, never
considering how false and groundless they are, or may be: for that
he wrongfully and falsely accused him in many things, will be manifest
to any unbiassed person, that will but take pains to read his
Life, written by that equitable Judge <em>Melchior Adams</em>, and that
large Preface the learned Physician <em>Fredericus Bitiskius</em> hath prefixed
to his Works printed at <em>Geneva</em> 1648.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>History 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. But if the Authors that report matters of fact in reference to
these four particulars that we have named, were ear and eye-witnesses,
and not single, but a greater number, and were not swayed
by any corrupt or self-interest whatsoever; yet all this is not sufficient
to give evidence in these matters, except they be rightly
qualified in other things, that are necessarily requisite to capacitate
a person rightly to judge of these nice and difficult matters,
some of the chief of which we shall here enumerate. 1. The persons
that are fit to give a perfect judgment of these matters, ought
to be perfect in the organs of their senses, otherwise they may easily
be deceived, and think the things otherwise than indeed they
are; so some defects or distempers in the ears, eyes, or the rest of
the sensories, may hinder the true perception of things acted or
done. 2. They ought to be of a sound judgment, and not of a
vitiated or distempered Phantasie, nor of a melancholick Temper
or Constitution; for such will be full of fears, and strange imaginations,
taking things as acted and wrought without, when they
are but only represented within. These will take a bush to be a
Boggard, and a black sheep to be a Demon; the noise of the
wild Swans flying high upon the nights, to be Spirits, or (as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>they call them here in the North) <em>Gabriel Ratchets</em>, the calling of
a Daker-hen in the Meadow to be the Whistlers, the howling of
the female Fox in a Gill, or a Clough for the male, when they are
for copulation, to be the cry of young Children, or such Creatures,
as the common people call Fayries, and many such like fancies
and mistakes. 3. They ought to be clear and free from those
imbibed notions of Spirits, Hobgoblins, and Witches, which have
been instamped upon their Phantasies from their very young years,
through ignorant and superstitious education, wherewith generally
all mankind is infected, and but very few that get themselves
extricated from those delusive Labyrinths, that parents and ignorance
have instilled into them. From hence it is, that not only
the stolid and stupid Vulgar, but even persons otherwise rational
enough, do commonly attribute those sleights and tricks that our
common Jugglers play, unto the Devil, when they are only performed
by Leger-de-main, or sleight of hand, Boxes, and Instruments
aptly fitted; and will not stick to believe, and strongly to affirm to
others, that they have seen the Jugglers Familiar or Devil, when
it was but a poor Squirrels skin stuffed with hair or moss, and nimbly
agitated by the hands of the Juggler: which makes me call
to mind a very lepid and pertinent Accident that once in my younger
years happened in <em>Burrow-bridge</em> upon a great Fayr holden
there upon St. <em>Barnabas</em> day: I being in Company with divers
Gentlemen, whereof two were Masters of Arts, and walking in the
Horse-Fayr, we espyed a great crowd and ring of people, and
drawing near, there was a person commonly known through most
of the Northern parts of <em>Yorkshire</em> by the name of <em>John Gypsie</em>,
being as black as any of that Tribe, with a Feather in his Hat, a
silk slasht Doublet, upon a fair Holland Half-shirt, counterfeiting
himself half drunk, and reeling to and fro, with a fine Tape or
Incle-string tyed fast together at the two ends, and throwing it,
(as it were) carelesly two or three times about a smooth Rod, that
another man held by both ends, and then putting the bout of the
Tape upon the one end of the Rod, and then crying, It is now fast
for five shillings; but no sooner reeling and looking aside, the man
that held the Rod did put off the bout of the Tape again, and still
<em>John Gypsie</em>, would cry and bet that it was fast, then would there
come two or three, and bet with him, and win, and go away (as
it were) laughing him to scorn, yet still he would continue, and
pray the Fellow that held the stick not to deceive him, and plainly
shew the people, that it would be fast when the bout was put on,
then would the Fellow that held the stick, still put off the bout when
<em>John Gypsie</em> looked away, whereby the people believed that he was
in drink, and so deceived by him that held the Rod, and so many
would come and bet with him, and lose: so that he used to win
much money, though the bout was put off every time, and none
could discern any alteration in the string. This strange Feat (which
I confess, as he handled and acted it, was one of the neatest that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>ever I saw in all my life) did so surprize all my Companions, and
in part himself, that some of them were of opinion, that he had
some stone in the Ring upon his finger, by virtue of which he performed
the Trick. But the most part concluded, that it could not
be done but by the power and help of the Devil, and resolved to
come no more near <em>John Gypsie</em>, as a man that was a Witch, and
had familiarity with the Devil. But I that then was much guilty
of curiosity, and loth to be imposed upon in a thing of that nature,
then also knowing the way and manner how all the common
Jugglers about <em>Cambridge</em> and <em>London</em> (who make a Trade of it)
did perform their Tricks, I slipt away from my Company, and went
to the place again where I found him still playing; and thrusting in,
I desired to hold the stick, which he refused not; and so in a short
time I perceived how it was done, and so returned to my Company,
and shewed them the sleight and mystery of it, which made
them very much ashamed of their folly and ignorance. They may
deride this story that list, and yet it may serve for instruction to
the wisest, and there are hundreds yet living that knew this person,
and where he was born, which was at <em>Bolton-bridge</em> near <em>Skipton</em>
in <em>Craven</em>, and have seen him play this trick of fast and loose,
as I have related it: so that if a man meet with a crafty cunning
Fellow, he commonly by way of Proverb calls him <em>John Gypsie</em>.
4. They ought to be free in their judgments as <i><span lang="co">in æquilibrio</span></i>, and
not to be radicated nor habituated in the belief of those things;
for then they will hardly be disswaded from their opinions, but
pertinaciously adhere unto them, though never so absurd, and will
be apt to ascribe all effects, that they understand not, unto Devils
and Witches, as is manifest in the Jesuit <em>Roberti Foster</em>, <em>Sennertus</em>,
and many others, who attributed the effects of the Hoplocrism or
Weapon-salve, and the Sympathetick Powder unto the operation
of the Devil and Witchcraft, when they are but meerly natural.
Which makes me call to mind a pretty story that happened when
I was but a young Boy. For where I once learned at the School,
there was one who was Rector of the Church, who was a very godly
man, a good and constant Preacher, accounted very learned, and
Bachelor of Divinity: this person being informed, that I and some
other Boys could play some odd Feats of sleight of hand, especially
to put a Ring upon our Cheek, and to throw it unto a staff
holden fast by both the ends; this he by no means did believe
could be done but by Diabolical means, and did advise and threaten
us to desist from such practices, as devillish and damnable. So
ready even the otherwise Learned may be, when once setled in
these fond and absurd opinions of the too great power of Demons
and Witches, to ascribe that unto them, which is performed by
Nature and lawful Art.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>That these things now in question are but barely supposed, and

<div class='sidenote'><em>Bodin. Dæmonoman. ubiq</em>; of evil Spirits, <em>pag.</em> 304.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Having in the preceding Chapter proved that the Scriptures
and sound Reason, are the proper Mediums to decide these
difficulties by, and also laid down the necessary qualifications requisite
in an Author or Witness that would evidence these things
as matters of fact: We shall here once again repeat the four Particulars,
which we are about to confute, which are these. 1. That
the Devil doth not make a visible or corporeal League and Covenant
with the supposed Witches. 2. That he doth not suck upon
their bodies. 3. That he hath not carnal Copulation with them.
4. That they are not really changed into Cats, Dogs, Wolves, or
the like. And these four Particulars we affirm were never matters
of fact, nor ever had a being, except only in the fancy as meer Chimera’s,
nor that they ever were or can be proved to have been
brought to pass or acted; and <i><span lang="la">de non apparentibus, &#38; non existentibus
eadem est ratio</span></i>, saith the great Maxime of our Law. But in
the first place let us hear what the Patrons of this wretched and
execrable opinion have to say to prove that they are matters of
fact, or were ever acted or performed. And first we have Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>
arguing at this rate: “All Histories are full of the exploits
of those instruments of darkness; and the testimony of all ages,
not only of the rude and barbarous, but of the most civilized and
polisht World, brings tidings of their strange performances. We
have the attestation of thousands of eye and ear-witnesses, and
those not of the easily deceivable vulgar only, but of grave
and wise discerners; and that when no interest could oblige them
to agree together in a common lye: I say we have the light of
all these circumstances to confirm us in the belief of things done
by persons of despicable power and knowledge, beyond the reach
of Art and ordinary Nature. Standing publick Records have
been kept of these well attested Relations, and Epocha’s made of
those unwonted events. Laws in many Nations have been enacted
against those vile practices; those among the Jews and our
own are notorious; such Cases have been often determined near
us, by wise and reverend Judges, upon clear convictive Evidence,
and thousands in our own Nation have suffered death for
their vile compacts with Apostate Spirits.” And a little after he
saith: “And I think those that can believe all Histories are Romances;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>that all the wiser World have agreed together to juggle
Mankind into a common belief of ungrounded Fables; that
the sound senses of multitudes together may deceive them, and
Laws are built upon Chimera’s; that the gravest and wisest Judges
have been Murderers, and the sagest persons Fools or designing
Impostors.” Bishop <em>Hall</em> maketh the like Objection, saying:
“Neither can I make question of the authentick Records of the
Examinations and Confessions of Witches and Sorcerers in several
Regions of the World, agreeing in the truth of their horrible
pacts with Satan, of their set Meetings with evil Spirits, their
beastly Homages and Conversations. I should hate to be guilty
of so much incredulity, as to charge so many grave Judges and
credible Historians with lyes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These Objections at the first view seem very plausible, and to
carry with them a great splendour and weight of truth and reason;
but if they be looked into, and narrowly weighed in the balance
of sound reason, and unbiassed judgment, they will be found too
light, and will soon vanish into Rhetorical fumes and frothy vapours:
which that it may be more clearly performed, we shall
rank them into the number of three, in which all their seeming
strength lyes, and these are they.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. They pretend that these things are sufficiently proved by Historians
of unquestionable credit and reputation.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. That the Confessions of Witches themselves, in divers Regions,
at several times and places, who have all acknowledged these
particulars, are sufficient evidence of the truth of these performances.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. That so many wise and grave Judges and honest Juries could
not have been deceived, to put to death such great numbers of
these kind of people, called or accounted Witches, without sufficient
proof of the matters of fact. To all which we shall give a
full response, in respect of the four particulars, mentioned in the
beginning of this Chapter, and shall commix and adjoyn such positive
Arguments as will be cogent to all rational persons, whose corrupt
wills have not perverted their judgments.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It is much to be admired, that Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> (but especially
Bishop <em>Hall</em>, a very Reverend and Learned person) should lye any
great stress upon such a weak foundation: For there is none of
these three Objections that will amount to a necessary Proposition,
but only to a contingent one, which will infer no certain and
necessary Conclusion, nor bring forth any certitude or science, but
only bare opinion and probability. <i><span lang="la">Propositio contingens est, quæ
sic vera est, ut falsa esse possit</span></i>: and at the best the strength of all
these are but <i><span lang="ca">testimonia humana</span></i>, which are but weak, and no sufficient
ground for a rational man to believe them to be true, because
<i><span lang="la">humanum est errare</span></i>. And the weight of these matters is not
a contention <i><span lang="la">de lana caprina, vel de umbra asini, sed de pelle humana</span></i>,
for the lives and estates of many poor Creatures, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>professed Christians too, and therefore doth require stronger Arguments
than contingent Propositions, to establish a firm ground for
the belief of this opinion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Prov. 12. 22.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. It is one thing barely to affirm, and another thing to prove
sufficiently and fully: For though they boldly alledge, that these
things are sufficiently proved by Authors of unquestionable credit
and verity, we must return a flat negative, and that for these reasons.
1. Let them shew us any one Author of credible veracity,
that ever was ear or eye-witness of the Devils making of a visible
and corporeal League or Bargain with the Witches, or that he ever
suckt upon their bodies, or that he had carnal Copulation with
them, or that by the experience of his senses ever certainly knew
a man really transubstantiated and transformed into a Wolf, or a
Wolf into a man, and we will yield the whole Cause. But we must
assert and truly affirm, that this pretence of theirs, that these things
are sufficiently proved by Historians of good credit, is a meer falsity,
and a lying flourish of vain words. There are (we confess)
a multitude of vain and lying stories, amassed up together in the
Writings of Demonographers and Witchmongers of strange and
odd Apparitions, Feats, Confessions, and such like; but never any
one positive proof of any of these four particulars by any Authors
of credit and reputation: and this we dare boldly aver to the world.
2. Let them produce any two Witnesses that were of honesty and
integrity, sound understandings and ability, that ever were present,
and ear and eye-witnesses of a visible, vocal, and corporeal
League made betwixt the Devil and the Witch; or let them tell
us who was by, and watched, and really and truly saw the Devil
suck upon some part of the Witches body; or who were the
Chamberlains, Pimps or Panders, when the Devil and the Witch
committed carnal Copulation; or who were ever present when a
Witch was changed into a Cat, a Dog, an Hare, or a Wolf. If they
can but bring forth any two credible Witnesses to prove these
things by, then we shall believe them, but we must assert that never
any such two could be produced yet: and therefore cannot but
wonder at the shameless impudence of such persons, that dare affirm
these things that never were, nor can be proved, and yet have not
blushed to vent and trumpet forth such execrable and abominable
lyes to the World. Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> confidently affirms these things to
be matters of fact, and <i><span lang="la">affirmanti incumbit probatio</span></i>, let him produce
his Witnesses, and if they be persons of judgment, veracity,
and impartiality, then we shall accept their proof; but it is not
figments, supposals, weak presumptions, or apparent falsities that
will perform it; for that which never was acted, can never truly
be proved, and things that appear not, are as though they were
not; therefore he must produce his testimonies, or lose both his
cause and credit, and must be taken for an Assertor of never-proved
Fables. <em>Lying lips are abomination unto the Lord: but they
that deal truly are his delight.</em></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Now we know they use to do in this case, as Souldiers use, who
when they are beaten forth of some Out-work or Trench, they
then retreat into another that they think more strong and safe. And
being driven from their weak Hold of a bare affirmation without
proof, that these things are verified to have been matters of fact,
and really performed, both by authority and the evidence of sense,
which are both utterly false, then they flye to this assertion: That
the Confessions of so many Witches in all Ages, in several Countries,
at divers times and places, all agreeing in these particulars,
are sufficient evidence of the truth of these matters. To which
we shall rejoyn, that the Confessions of Witches, however considered,
are not of credit and validity to prove these things; but
are in themselves null and void, as false, impossible, and forged lyes,
which we shall make good by these following Reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. The Witch must be taken to be either a person <i><span lang="la">insanæ, vel
sanæ mentis</span></i>; and if they be <i><span lang="la">insanæ mentis</span></i>, their Confessions are
no sufficient evidence, nor worthy of any credit; because there is
neither Reason, Law, nor Equity that allows the testimony or
confession of an Idiot, Lunatick, mad or doting person, because
they are not of a right and sound understanding, and are not to be
accounted as <i><span lang="la">compotes mentis</span></i>, nor governed by rationability. For
as by the Civil Law mad Folks, Idiots, and Old men childish,
Bond-slaves, and Villains are not capable of making a Will to dispose
of Goods, Lands, or Chattels: so much more are all these
sorts of persons excepted for giving evidence by confessions, or
otherwise in matters concerning life and death, which are of far
greater weight and concernment. And that these persons are of
unsound understandings, is manifest in all the points that they confess,
and therefore are no proof, nor ought to be credited: and
that for these reasons. 1. Because the things they confess are not
attested by any other persons of integrity and sound judgment,
and they must of necessity be lyars, because the Bond-slaves of the
Devil, whose works they will do, and he was a lyar from the beginning.
2. Because they confess things that are impossible (as
we shall prove anon) and <i><span lang="la">confiteri impossibilia insanientis est</span></i>.
3. There is no good end wherefore they make these Confessions,
neither do they receive any benefit by them, either spiritual or temporal,
internal nor external. And this doth sufficiently shew, that
they are deluded, melancholy, and mad persons, and so their Confessions
of no credit, truth, or validity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Thess. 2. 10, 11, 12.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Tim. 2. 26.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Joh. 8. 44.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Their Confessions will be found null and false, if we consider
the impulsive cause that moves them to make them, and the end
wherefore they declare such false and lying matters, and that in
these particulars. 1. The moving cause is not, nor can be the Spirit
of God, which is a Spirit of truth and righteousness, nor any
motion of true remorse for their sins, or any thing flowing from
repentant hearts, because they are persons forsaken of God and his
Grace, and given over to reprobate minds and senses, and therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the truth of the Word of God is fulfilled in them: <em>Because they
received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved, therefore
God shall send them strong delusion, that they might believe a
lye. That they all might be damned, who believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</em> 2. Neither is the end for the
glory of God, or their own Salvation, because they are the Vassals
and Bond-slaves of Satan, being kept Captive at his will, and are
Rebels and Traitors against God and Christ, his Church and Truth,
having renounced the Faith, and become Apostata’s to the truth.
3. The impulsive cause and chief end wherefore they make these
and such like confessions, is sometimes, and in some persons meerly
to eschew torture and bodily pains, and sometimes the quite contrary
solely to escape the present miseries of a poor, wretched, and
troublesom life; and therefore these confessions not at all to be
credited, as being vain and feigned. 4. Sometimes they are by
force, waking, craft, and cunning, in hope of pardon and life, to
make such confessions as the base ends and corrupt intentions of
the Inquisitors themselves, or their Agents, have infused into
them, for the advancement of false Doctrine, Superstition, and Idolatry:
such were the most (if not all) recorded by <em>Delrio Bodinus</em>,
and the rest of the Witchmongers, to which no credit can be
given at all. 5. But the chief end that Satan hath (who is the Forger,
Contriver, and Deviser of these Confessions, if voluntarily and
freely made, the principal Agent in all these matters) is to set forth
the power and glory of his own Kingdom, thereby to lead men
into, and continue them in lyes and errors; <em>for when he speaketh
a lye, he speaketh of his own, for he is a lyar, and the father of it</em>,
and the Witches are his Children, and the works of their Father
the Devil they will do, and he was, and is a Murtherer and
Lyar from the beginning. And thus far we acknowledge a spiritual
and mental League betwixt the Witch and the Devil, by virtue
of which they confess these horrible and abominable lyes, of
the glory of him and his Kingdom; but other League or Covenant
there is none, neither is there any the least spark of truth in all
that they say or confess, because their sole end in making of these
confessions, is to advance the credit and power of Satan. 6. The
impulsive cause that often makes them to utter such confessions of
strange and impossible things, is the strong passive delusion, that
they lye under, contracted by ignorant, unchristian, and superstitious
education, which they have suckt in with their milk, heightned
with an atrabilarious temper and constitution, and confirmed
by the wicked lyes, and teaching of others, which makes them
confess these execrable things, which they in their depraved and
vitiated imaginations, do think and believe they have done and
suffered, when there was never truly acted any such matter <i><span lang="la">ad extrà</span></i>,
but only in their mad and deluded Phantasies: and so no more
credit to be given to them, than to the maddest Melancholist that
ever was read or heard of.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>3. That there is not any jot of truth in these Confessions, is manifest,
if we consider the subjective matter of them, as is plain by
these ensuing grounds. 1. For the most of them are not credible,
by reason of their obscenity and filthiness; for chast ears would
tingle to hear such bawdy and immodest lyes; and what pure and
sober minds would not nauseate and startle to understand such unclean
stories, as of the carnal Copulation of the Devil with a Witch,
or of his sucking the Teat or Wart of an old stinking and rotten
Carkass? surely even the impurity of it may be sufficient to overthrow
the credibility of it, especially amongst Christians. 2. There
are many things that have no verity in them at all, that notwithstanding
have verisimilitude; but these are not only void of truth,
but also of truth-likeliness: for it is neither truth, nor hath any likelihood
of it, to believe it for a truth, that the Devil should carry
an old Witch in the Air into foraign Regions, that can hardly
crawl with a staff, to dancing and banqueting, and yet to return
with an empty belly, and the next day to be forced, like old <em>Dembdike</em>
or <em>Elizabeth Sothernes</em>, and <em>Alizon Denice</em>, to go a begging
with the sowr-milk Can: is this either probable or likely? would
it not much more have advantaged the Devils interest and his Kingdom,
to have furnished them with good and true meat and drink,
and not with such imaginary Cates, which would neither fill the stomach,
nor satisfie the appetite? Had it not been more for the Devils
benefit to have furnished them with plenty of gold and silver,
than to let them go ragged and tattered, begging their bread from
door to door? 3. As these confessions have no truth-likeliness
in them, so they are things that are simply impossible to be performed
by any created power, and therefore must needs be false
and fictitious relations; for no Creature can perform any thing but
that for which by Creation it was ordered and designed to; but
the Devils by Creation have no generative power given them, nor
members or organs to perform the act of copulation withal; and
therefore their having carnal copulation with the Witches, is a
most monstrous fiction, and an absolute impossibility, and can have
nothing in it more than the stirring up of the imaginative faculty,
and thereby to move titillation in the members fitted for the act
of generation, which is a thing that happens to many both men and
women, that are of hot constitutions, and abound with seed, which
we call <i><span lang="la">nocturnæ prolutiones</span></i>, of which the Divines and Casuists
make that great question, <i><span lang="la">An nocturnæ prolutiones sint peccatum?</span></i>
And it is as simply impossible for either the Devil or Witches to
change or alter the course that God hath set in Nature, as to transubstantiate
a man or woman into a Cat, a Dog, or a Wolf; and
therefore are these confessions meer impossibilities and monstrous
lyes. 4. There can in sound and right reason no credit at all be
given to these confessions, because divers of them have been proved
to be utterly false, as is plain in the man that did confidently affirm,
that he was a true Wolf, and that he had hair under his skin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the woful tryal of which was his death, though a pregnant and undeniable
proof, that the delusion was in the Phantasie, and that
there was no real change of the mans body into a Wolf; and
therefore doth flatly overthrow the credibility of these vain and
lying confessions. To the same purpose is the story related by <i><span lang="la">Camerarius</span></i>
from <em>Johannes Baptista Porta</em>, a great Naturalist, and a
person of competent veracity, which is this. “Once (saith he)
I met an old Witch, one of those that are said to enter houses in
the night time, and there to suck the blood of little children lying
in their Cradles. Having asked her a question of something,
she promised forthwith, that within a while she would give me
answer. She puts forth of her Chamber all those that went in
with me to be witnesses of that which should pass. Having shut
us out, she strips her self stark naked, and rubs over all her body
with a certain Oyntment, which we saw through the chinks of
the door. The operation of the soporiferous juyces, whereof
this Oyntment was compounded, made her fall to the ground,
and brought her into a deep sleep. Upon this we open the door,
and some of us begin to strike and knock her well-favour’dly;
but she was so soundly asleep, that to strike her body and a stone,
it was all one. Forth we go again, in the mean time the Oyntment
had ended his working, and the old Trot being awaked,
and having put on her cloaths, begins to tell tales of <em>Robin Hood</em>,
saying, That she had passed over Seas and Mountains, and then
gives us false answers. We tell her, that her body had never
stir’d out of the Chamber; she maintains the contrary: we shew
her the blows we had given her, she persisteth the more stifly in
her opinion.” By the testimony of this Author, who was an ear
and eye-witness of this passage, and other persons with him, which
manifests it to be good and sufficient evidence, it appeareth, that
the Witches are under a melancholy and passive delusion, promoted
by the help of soporiforous Oyntments, whereby they fancy and
think they are carried into far remote places, where they hear and
see strange things, and do and suffer that which is not at all performed,
but only as in a dream, their bodies in the mean time lying
immoveable, and so do but relate falsities and lyes, which is an
unanswerable proof of the absolute falsity of their confessions, the
thing that here we undertook to make good. And some late
Learned men (with Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> himself) giving too much credit to
the things related by the Witches in their confessions, to be true
stories of things really performed at a great distance, have been
forced to revive that old Platonical Whimsie, of the Souls real egression
forth of the body into far distant places, and its return again,
with the certain knowledge of things there done or said, according
to the relation that <em>Pliny</em> gives us in these words: <i><span lang="la">Reperimus (inquit)
interempla, Hermotimi Clazomenii animam relicto corpore
errare solitam, vagámq; è longinquo multa annuntiare, quæ nisi à
præsenti nosci non possent, corpore interim semianimi: donec cremato
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>eo inimici (qui Cantharidæ vocabantur) remeanti animæ velut
vaginam ademerint</span></i>. To which notwithstanding he doth not
seem to give credence. But these Relations of the Witches are
meer lyes and forgeries, and are but taught them by the spiritual
craft of the Devil, thereby to pretend to imitate the true Visions
that the Prophets had from God. And though there may be some
peculiar persons that have the way to fall into ecstasies, (as <em>Helmont</em>
witnesseth of himself) and may thereby understand many
mystical matters, yet in it there is no real egression of the Soul
forth of the body, but a freeing or withdrawing of it from the
Phantasie and Senses, and then (as the Cabbalists and mystical Authors
say) it is joyned to the intelligible World, and beholds
things as present, and though there may be something of truth in
it, yet few Authors of credit and veracity, have attested it upon
their own experience, and there may be much fallacy and danger
in it, and therefore we leave it to further search and inquiry. Another
apparent ground of the nullity of the truth or credit of these
confessions, is that which a learned Divine in his Letter to Dr.
<em>Wierus</em> gives us, the substance of which we shall give in English,
which is this: “I have known (he saith) the year foregoing (he
writ his Epistle <i><span lang="it">Anno</span></i> 1565.) many foolish things from the private
confession of a certain old Woman, an Inchanter, who when
she had heard in my Sermon the place in the 19. Chapter of the
<em>Acts</em> explained, <em>That many of the Ephesians, being of those who
had exercised curious Arts, had brought their Books, and burned
them openly, &#38;c.</em> She forthwith (he saith) came unto me with
a mind plainly troubled; and with tears pouring forth into my
bosom the secrets of her breast, did receive Christian instruction;
and when she had understood, by the blessing of God, the vanity
of Diabolical Impostures, and perceived them with opened eyes,
she was easily converted to the light of truth, the smoak of lyes
being laid aside. She, truth being once received, hath most constantly
confessed, that it did appear to her more clear than the light
at noon day, that Satan did only deceive and blind the eyes of his
Vassals, and that there was nothing done in verity, and this she declared
with a detestation of her Diabolical Art.” And so concludes
it in these words: <i><span lang="la">Vno verbo dicam, me satis experientiâ didicisse,
bonam partem incantationum mera esse insomnia</span></i>. And whosoever
shall read, and seriously consider the Epistle of that excellent and
learned Divine, will find the most of those vain illusions laid open
and confuted: so that in all (or the most) of the things attributed
unto Witches, we shall find no more of Diabolical operation in
them, than an internal, mental, and spiritual delusion, in making
the Witches to believe, and to draw on others to the same opinion
that the Devil hath a kind omnipotent Power and Soveraignty.
Therefore did <em>Aristotle</em> well conclude: <i><span lang="la">Incantamenta esse muliercularum
figmenta</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Psal. 62. 4.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. A fourth Reason of the meer falsity and incredibility of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Confessions is this: Is it possibly credible to a rational and unbiassed
judgment, that the Witches (though never so many, at
several times and places) having made themselves the Slaves and
Vassals of the Devil, both in soul and body, and being led by his
lying and deceitful Spirit (though making large and voluntary
confessions) can be conceived to have any touch of truth in them
at all? Surely no more truth in these confessions, than there is in
the Devil, who was a Lyar from the beginning; and therefore we
argue thus. Such kind of will, affections and inclinations as are in
the Devil himself, such kind are in his Children. But the will and
affections of the Devil are against God, his Truth, and against all
Gods people, and his inclinations tend to continual lying. Therefore
the will, affections, and inclinations of his Children (such as
the Witches are, and are granted to be) are against God, his Truth,
and against all Gods people, and their inclinations tend to continual
lying. The proof of the major and minor Proposition is the
plain words of our Saviour, <em>Ye are of your father the devil, and the
lusts of your father the devil ye will do</em>, <span lang="grc">θέλετε ποιεῖν</span>, <em>and he was a
murtherer from the beginnings and abode not in the truth, because
there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lye, he speaketh of his
own: for he is a lyar, and the father of it.</em> And again St. <em>John</em> tells
us: <em>He that committeth sin, is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
from the beginning</em>. So that it may truly be said of them, <em>They delight
in lyes</em>, and their confessions are nothing but lyes. And if
they object and say, that here we confess a League with the Devil
and the Witch, otherwise the Witches could not be his Children,
Vassals, and Bond-slaves, which elsewhere we deny; we
answer, it is a gross mistake, in not observing the distinction we
make betwixt a mental and spiritual League, such as the Devil
and <em>Judas</em> made, and such as all wicked men make with him, and
under this League we acknowledge all Witches to be; but a visible
and corporeal League we positively deny, and so the objection
is of no validity. And thus we suppose we have sufficiently
proved, that there ought no credit at all to be given to the Confessions
of Witches, no more than to Devils, who are all lyars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now let us proceed to their third main Objection: That so
many wise and grave Judges and honest Juries could not have been
deceived, to put to death such great numbers of those kind of people,
without sufficient proof of the matters of fact. Against which
we oppose these following Reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. It is but an Argument at the best to drive the other Party into
an absurdity, which is not of any such dangerous consequence,
as may be supposed; for it would but conclude, that many grave
and wise Judges and Juries have been imposed upon, and deceived,
which is but <i><span lang="la">argumentum ad homines</span></i>, and doubtless many
might, and have been. And do not we Christians hold, that the
gravest and wisest Judges amongst the <em>Turks</em> and <em>Persians</em> have
been, and are deceived, and have done unjustly in persecuting and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>putting Christians to death, because they would not submit to the
Religion of <em>Mahomet</em>, and yet we account it no absurdity or injustice
to pass that censure upon them? And do not the Idolaters
in all those large Empires and Kingdoms of <em>Tartary</em>, <em>China</em>, the
<em>Moguls</em> Country, and the rest of those Countries in the East of <em>Asia</em>
persecute and put many to death, for not worshipping their Idols,
or embracing their Religion; and do we think it absurd to censure
and condemn them of injustice, though in their own Countries
they be accounted grave and wise Judges? Surely we do not, and
there is the parity of reason in both the Arguments, for all are but
men, and so may erre.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. But as for the grave, learned, and wise Judges, and understanding
and honest Juries within His Majesties Dominions, we
affirm they are clear and innocent from these imputations, and that
for divers and sundry sound reasons. 1. Our Judges and Juries have
no such sinister and corrupt ends, to wrest the Laws, or wring forth
and extort feigned and false Confessions, because they have no such
ends as to uphold and maintain idolatrous and superstitious Tenents,
as praying to Saints, magnifying of Holy water, or setting up
of Purgatory, as had the Popish Inquisitors, and the Demonographers,
and Witchmongers that writ for those ends. And therefore
it is no absurdity to say or think, that they dealt unjustly in
their proceedings, which our learned and pious Judges are not, nor
can be guilty of. 2. The Inquisitors and their Agents had benefit
by the death of Witches, having a share in their Goods, and therefore
no absurdity to conclude, that their proceedings were unjust,
partial, and corrupt, of which our judges and Juries are clear, as
having no profit at all by the death of these wretched and deluded
people. 3. Our Judges are but sworn to the due execution of
the Laws made, and the Juries sworn to bring in their Verdicts according
to their best evidence: now if the Witnesses forth of malice,
envy, ignorance, or mistake swear to matters of fact, for which
death or other punishments are allotted by the Law, both the
Judges and the Jury are absolutely excusable; and if there be any
guilt in the Witnesses, or falsity in their Evidences, it lyes at their
own doors, and upon their own consciences, and the Judges and Jurors
are clear, and not to be blamed, for no humane prudence can
altogether prevent, that Witnesses may not erre or swear falsely.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Have there not been many thousands of true and faithful
Martyrs, that have suffered and been condemned in many Ages, in
many and several Countries, at many different and distinct times?
And some of these have been condemned by such as were called
and accounted General Councils, Parliaments, High-Courts of Justice,
and other places of great Judicature, before Judges that were
accounted wise, grave, and learned, and by Juries of honesty and
understanding: were there therefore no true Martyrs, and were
they all justly condemned and put to death? or is it absurd to be
guilty of such incredulity, as to think and hold, that so many grave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and wise Judges, and knowing Juries were deceived, and did unjustly?
Let Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> or any other solve this Argument; and
carry the cause; or else we must necessarily conclude, that <i><span lang="la">opinio
quæ à se non propellit absurda, per absurda non premit adversarium</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now having given a full and satisfactory Answer to their main
and strongest Objections, and defeated the whole force of their first
and most furious Charge, we shall proceed to overthrow their main
Battel, in proving the four Particulars mentioned in the beginning
of the Chapter, to be false and impossible. And in doing of this,
we shall handle the three first promiscuously and all together, and
the fourth about Transubstantiations or Change of Witches into
Cats, Hares, Dogs, Wolves, or the like, we shall handle by it
self.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Joh. 13. 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. And first we acknowledge an internal, mental, and spiritual
League or Covenant betwixt the Devil and all wicked persons,
such as are Thieves, Robbers, Murtherers, Impostors, and the like,
whereby the temptations, suggestions, and allurements of Satan,
spiritually darted, and cast into the mind, the persons so wrought
upon, and prevailed withal, do assent and consent unto the motions
and counsels of the evil Spirit, and so do make a League and Covenant
with the said evil Spirit, as saith the Text: <em>According to
the Prince of the power of the air, that now worketh in the children
of disobedience</em>. He doth not only rule over them, but also worketh
in them; for men are either the Temples of God, or the Temples
of Satan and Antichrist, <em>who sitteth in the Temple of God, and
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that it called God or worshipped</em>.
Such a spiritual League or Covenant as this did <em>Judas</em>
make with the Devil, whereby he agreed to betray his Master
Christ. <em>Then entred Satan into Judas</em>: not that essentially or
personally he entred into <em>Judas</em>, but that he put it into his heart,
<span lang="grc">βεβληκότος</span>, to betray him: which wrought so effectively in him in a
spiritual manner, that he took up that Diabolical resolution to
betray his innocent Master: and this was entring into a spiritual
League with the Devil. For as <em>Theophylact</em> saith upon the place.
<i><span lang="la">Hoc enim significat, spospondit, hoc est, perfectam promissionem &#38;
pactum fecit.</span></i> And another saith: <i><span lang="la">In Judam Satanas intravit, non
impellens, sed patulum inveniens ostium: nam oblitus omnium quæ
viderat, ad solam avaritiam dirigebat intuitum</span></i>. And again:
<i><span lang="la">Missio ista spiritualis suggestio est, &#38; non fit per aurem, sed per cogitationem:
diabolicæ enim suggestiones immittuntur, &#38; humanis
cogitationibus immiscentur</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. We acknowledge that this spiritual League in some respects
and in some persons may be, and is an explicit League, that is, the
persons that enter into it, are or may be conscious of it, and know
it to be so; for when a person resolves to murther, he cannot but
know that he then maketh a League with the Devil, who was a
Murtherer from the beginning. And it is manifest, that in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>League, and in no other, were all the Priests that belonged to the
Oracles, who knew well enough that the Idols or false Gods they
worshipped, did give no answers at all, but the responsions given
were only of their own devising and framing, to uphold their credit;
and more colourably to cozen and deceive the people, they
did pretend that they had answers from their Gods or Idols, and
thus far the Devil was in all their impostures and jugglings. And
so all the several sorts of the Diviners or Witches mentioned in the
Old Testament, were under a spiritual League with the Devil, and
did very well know, that what they did, was not by the finger of
God, but either by the help of Art, Nature, Leger-de-main, Confederacy,
or such like impostures and cheats: and yet they pretended,
as did <em>Simon Magus</em>, and gave out that they were some great
men, thereby to deceive others, when explicitly they plainly knew
that themselves were but dissemblers and lyars, and that for gain,
credit, and vain-glory they pretended to do those things, which
they could never truly perform. And under this spiritual League,
explicitly considered, are all our Figure-flingers contained, who
take upon them (far beyond the Rules of the true Art) to declare
where stollen Goods are, and to cause them to be brought back
again, and many other such vain and lying matters, which they
well know they have no power to perform, but that they willingly
and knowingly take upon them to pretend to do these things for
vain-glory and filthy lucre sake. And of this sort are all our pretending
Conjurers, Diviners, Wizards, and those that take upon
them to reveal things by looking in Crystals, Beryls, and the like,
(of which we may perhaps speak more largely hereafter) that indeed
know well enough they do but deceive and cheat others: of
all which we could recite very lepid and apposite stories, certainly
known unto us, or discovered by us; but Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> would account
them but silly Legends and old Wives Fables, and therefore
we shall supersede here, and leave them to a fitter place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isa. 8. 19, 20.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Calvin in loc.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. There are others that are under this spiritual League, though
implicitly, as are all those that we have granted to be passively deluded
Witches, those that by ignorant and irreligious education,
joyned with a melancholy temper and disposition, to which they
have added Charms, Pictures, and other superstitious Ceremonies,
which they learned by Tradition. By all which they become so
deluded and besotted in their Phantasies, that they believe the Devil
doth visibly appear unto them, suck upon them, have carnal
copulation with them, that they are carried in the Air to feastings,
dancings, and such like Night-revellings; and that they can raise
tempests, kill men or beasts, and an hundred such like fopperies
and impossibilities, when they do nor suffer any thing at all, but in
their depraved and deceived imaginations. And so do blindly and
implicitly believe that the Devil doth perform all these things for
them, when indeed and truth he doth nothing but dart and cast in
these filthy and fond cogitations into their minds agreeable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>their wicked wills and corrupted desires, and so are fast bound in
this spiritual and implicit League. And under this spiritual implicit
League are also comprehended all those that are Witchmongers,
and believe the verity and performance of these things, and
think that the Devil can both hurt and also help, and that there is
a bad and a good Witch, or with Mr. <em>Perkins</em>, a black and a white
one, by which wicked opinion, the seeking unto Witches, Wizards,
Mutterers, Murmurers, Charmers, South-sayers, Conjurers, Cunning-men
and women (as we speak here in the North) and such
like, is still upholden by the Authors and Favourers of this opinion,
contrary to the direct counsel of the Holy Ghost, who saith: <em>And
when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar Spirits,
and unto Wizards that peep and that mutter; should not a
people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead. To the
law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,
it is because there is no light in them.</em> And therefore saith one:
<i><span lang="la">Admonet etiam, nos adversus impios cultus &#38; superstitiones tutos
fore, si in lege Domini acquiescamus</span></i>. The League or Covenant
betwixt the Devil and the Witch, is that which is visible and corporeal,
where he is supposed to appear in some bodily shape unto
the Witch, and to have oral and audible conference with him or
her, and so to make a League or Covenant; and this is the thing
that we deny, and the consequents thereof, that he doth not suck
upon their bodies, nor hath carnal copulation with them, nor carries
them in the Air, nor for them, nor by them doth destroy or
kill man or beast, raise tempests, or change them into Cats, Hares,
Wolves, Dogs, or the like; and this we oppose with these following
Reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Mat. 24. 24.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Tim. 2. 25, 26.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Whatsoever the Devil worketh, it is to bring advantage to
his own Kingdom, or otherwise he should act in vain. But whatsoever
he worketh by a visible Covenant, is not for the advantage
of his own Kingdom: and therefore it is in vain. The major is
plain from the Text: <em>Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary
the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may
devour, whom resist stedfast in the faith</em>. The minor is manifest in
these two particulars. 1. <em>Satan is that old Serpent, that was, and
is more subtile than any beast of the field, which the Lord God hath
created</em>: which notwithstanding the vain Cavils, and seeming Arguments
of <em>Pererius</em>, must be understood of Satan the Adversary
of Mankind, and not of the natural Serpent, which is not the most
subtile beast that God hath created, there being many others more
subtile than the Serpent; and the Scripture tells us of his cunning
and wiliness: for the Apostle saith, <em>We are not ignorant of his
wiles or devices</em> <span lang="grc">νοήματα</span>. And the Apostle in another place calls
them <span lang="grc">μεθοδείας</span>, <em>his wiles</em>, which are so great, <em>that if it were possible,
they might deceive the very elect</em>. So that he wants no cunning
nor subtilty to know how to bring a sinner into his snare, and to
hold him fast, and when he is fast, he knows he need do no more,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and therefore acts not in vain. 2. Before he need attempt a visible
apparition to the Witch (if any such thing could be) he
knows that the Witch is sure and fast in his snare by a spiritual Covenant
already entred into, and therefore knows he need do no
more, and he is too cunning to act to no purpose, and therefore
doth St. <em>Paul</em> warn <em>Timothy</em>, <em>That a Bishop must have a good report,
lest he fall into the snare of the devil</em>, all sins being the snares of the
Devil, and when men are fast taken in them, they are in Satans
fetters, and he labours no more but to keep them there. And so
the same Apostle speaketh of those that oppose the Gospel, <em>that
they must be instructed in meekness, that they may recover themselves
out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at
his will</em>. So that sins keep men in the spiritual snare of the Devil,
and so are all those that are accounted Witches, in that spiritual
snare, holden fast enough by their own consents and corrupt
wills, and need no bodily apparition to make them surer: and so
this visible League falls to the ground, as having no ground nor
end why it should be made. And for the Devil to appear like a
Dog or a Cat, and speak, would sure not only fright and startle an
old Witch, but even the boldest and most stout-hearted person.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. The Witches by visible apparitions of the Devil (if any such
thing could be) in any shape, could have no more assurance of
Satans performances, than they have already, by mental perswasion,
and the dominion of him in their hearts, <em>who is the Prince of
the air, and worketh in the children of disobedience</em>, because by that
visible appearance there is not brought any Hostages or Witnesses,
which are absolutely necessary to confirm such a League or Covenant.
And these representations being made in their imaginations
and fancies, wherein they think they see, do, and suffer these delusive
Visions, they are most firmly and pertinaciously confirmed in
the belief of them, that any Apparition externally must needs be
vain and superfluous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. If the Witches be not superlatively mad (and if so, then so to
be judged of, and all that in this point is believed of them either
in doing, suffering, or otherwise, must be judged extreme folly and
madness) they will not make a League with the Devil, knowing
him to be the Devil, because they cannot but know that he was
and is a Lyar and a Murtherer from the beginning, and hath deceived
many before them, that were of the same way and profession.
And a visible appearance can afford them no certain security, but
that he may and will deceive them still, and that he continueth a
lyar and a deceiver. But while the delusion is internal, and the
imagination depraved, and led by the suggestions and motions of
Satan, they then are so blinded, that they see not, nor understand
the danger they run into, nor the certainty of the deceit they lye
under, which a visible Apparition would sooner shake and overthrow,
than any way confirm, and therefore is false and needless.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. But how come the Witches certainly to know that the Devil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>can perform such things as they would have done? Surely by no
means, but either by traditional hear-say or inward delusion; the
one they know not, but that it is a lye, and the other concludeth
their passive delusion, to neither of which a visible Apparition like
a Cat or a Dog, and speaking unto them, can bring any confirmation,
except the Devil should bring them good store of gold or
silver, or work some strange feat before their eyes, as to kill some
men or beasts, or the like; but none of these things are ever proved
to be performed. And therefore it is not rational to believe
that Witches do make a visible and corporeal League with the Devil,
because by it they can have no certain knowledge, that he either
can or will accomplish such things for them, as they desire.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The Devil cannot by his own power or will, either appear
visibly in what shape he please, neither can he when he will, nor
as he will, perform these strange tricks, because he is under restraint,
and can act nothing but as the will of God orders and determines:
so God sent an evil Spirit upon <em>Saul</em>, otherwise he could not have
troubled him; and the Devils could not enter into the herd of
Swine, until leave was given them by our Saviour; neither could
he afflict <em>Job</em>, until that Gods hand was laid upon him, and God
ordered him to be an instrument in that affliction. And though
the Devil be said <em>to walk about like a roaring lion, seeking whom
he may devour</em>, yet must that walking about be only understood
(and is so taken by all sound Expositors) of the evil and wicked
intention of his will, according to which he is always ready seeking
whom he may devour, if he be so ordered or permitted of God
(ordering and permission in this point, being but all one act of the
divine Will and Providence) and not in regard of his power or liberty
to act or execute what he please, and when and as he lift;
for the same Apostle and also St. <em>Jude</em> telleth us, <em>that he is kept in
chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment</em>, and by those chains
he is kept, that he cannot hurt or destroy, when and where he list,
but as he is sent and appointed of God, either to tempt or afflict
the godly, or to punish the wicked; and therefore the sentence of
St. <em>Austin</em> is much to be weighed and considered, who saith: <i><span lang="la">Diabolus
plerumq; vult nocere, &#38; non potest, quia potestas ista est sub
potestate: nam si tantum posset nocere Diabolus quantum vult, aliquis
justorum non remaneret</span></i>. And therefore I cannot but transcribe
here the opinion of that pious and learned person Bishop <em>Hall</em> upon
this very particular, which is this: “Could <em>Samson</em> have been
firmly bound hand and foot by the Philistine cords, so as he could
not have stirred those mighty limbs of his, what Boy or Girl of
<em>Gath</em> or <em>Ascalon</em> would have feared to draw near and spurn that
awed Champion? No other is the condition of our dreadful enemies,
they are fast bound up with the adamantine chains of Gods
most merciful and inviolable Decree, and forcibly restrained
from their desired mischief. Who can be afraid of a muzled and
tyed up Mastive? what woman or child cannot make faces at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>fierce Lyon, or a bloody <em>Bajazet</em> lockt up fast in an Iron Grate?
Were it not for this strong and strait curb of divine Providence,
what good man could breathe one minute upon earth? The Demoniack
in the Gospel could break his iron fetters in pieces,
through the help of his Legion; those Devils that possessed him
could not break theirs; they are fain to sue for leave to enter
into Swine, neither had obtained it (in all likelihood) but for a
just punishment to those <em>Gaderene</em> owners: How sure may we
then be, that this just hand of Omnipotence will not suffer these
evil ones to tyrannize over his chosen Vessels for their hurt?
How safe are we, since their power is limited, our protection infinite?”
So that if the Devil be thus chained and restrained by the
omnipotent Decree and Providence, that he cannot execute any
evil, but as he is ordered of God, and that God doth not let him
loose but for just causes and reasons; then can it not be that the
Devil doth visibly appear and make Leagues with Witches, nor
work such strange things for them, because there is no just or reasonable
end that can be assigned, why God should order him to do
these things; and therefore a visible League with Witches is meerly
false and fraudulent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 6.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>6. This pretended League must needs be a lye and a figment,
because of the effects that are feigned to follow, as to have carnal
copulation with the Devil, to raise storms and tempests, to flye in
the air, and to kill men and beasts. For if these things be done,
they are either performed by the Witches own natural power, or
by the Devils. If by the Witches natural power, or the force of
her resuscitated imagination and strength of will to work <i><span lang="la">ad nutum</span></i>
(as <em>Van Helmont</em> seems to hold) then the Devil operateth
nothing, but in playing the Impostor, and deceiving the Witch,
and that he may easily do by internal and mental delusion, and
needs no visible League to bring it to pass. And if the Witch kill
men or beasts, or perform any of the fore-cited Feats by natural
means or Agents, then where is the Devils power, or wherein is
the Witchcraft or Fascination, or where is the effect of the League?
And if the Witch kill by natural means, then the natural Agent is
not simply evil, but in the use and application. As a Sword is a
natural and lawful instrument for an honest man to use, to defend
his life withal, in using of it with his natural power and skill; but
if a Thief or a Robber, with his natural power and skill, use a
Sword to kill and murther an honest man withal, it is wickedness
in the use and end, but not in the agency of the Thief, nor in the
effect of the Sword. So if the Witch by any natural means (though
never so secret) do kill a man or child, it is murther; but wherein
lyes the Witchcraft? Is it any thing else but <i><span lang="la">Veneficium</span></i> (as both
the Greek and Latine words do import) to kill by some secret
way of poysoning? Shew what Witchcraft there is in it besides.
If the Devil by his own power kill a man, or perform the Witches
carrying in the air, and the like, let us know how, or by what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>means he performeth the same? If what the Devil performeth in
natural and corporeal matter, be (as the Fathers, Schoolmen, and
Divines most generally hold) by applying natural Agents, to fit
passives, then the effect is natural, and so in killing any person, it is
only wicked and diabolical, in regard of the end, which is murther,
but what Witchcraft is there in the means and operation? And
therefore <em>Guiterrius</em> strongly concludeth thus. “If there be no
natural Fascination, there can be no diabolical; but there is no
natural Fascination (as he thinketh he hath sufficiently proved)
therefore he concludeth there is no diabolical Fascination at all.”
There is no way to solve this Argument, but either in denying that
the Devil worketh these things by natural means, and then it crosseth
the opinion of all the Learned in general, ancient, middle,
and modern, or by proving that there is natural Fascination, and
then diabolical is but in vain and needless.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas 7.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>7. How can the Witches (if not maniacal in the highest degree)
believe, that the Devil who is a Lyar, and the Father of lyes, and
whom they cannot but know hath in the like cases deceived many,
that have (in their opinion) made contracts with him, will
prove true in the performance of his promise? Or that he who is
the enemy of all truth and goodness, and laboureth to deceive all
Mankind, will be faithful to perform his promise, or to do them
any good, either real or apparent? Or (if the Witches be not incredibly
mad) can they believe that he will perform without Hostages,
Bonds-men, or Sureties? when we find that the weakest and
maddest of Mortals, if he make a Covenant with another of known
loosness and deceit, though for a thing of a far less value, than either
soul or body, will he not require sufficient Bonds-men and
Security? Now what Bonds-men or Security can the Witches
have?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 8.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>8. And if the Witches be not beyond measure deluded and mad,
must they not rationally know, that if the Devil deceive them (as
he is sure to do) there is no recompence to be had, nor any that
can compel him to perform bargains? Before what Judicature,
before what Judges, by what Law must they call him to an account,
or have him punished? So that in all reason and sound judgment
we must conclude the Witches to be absolutely mad, and then
all these things also madness, lyes and folly, or that there is not, nor
ever was any such League or Covenant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 9.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>See the Arraignment of Witches in <em>Lancast. Ann.</em> 10. <em>Jacobi.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>9. But if all this were granted, yet who are the Witnesses to this
visible League or Covenant, can the Witches name or find any?
The things that cannot be proved by sufficient Witnesses, are never
to be believed, and we have proved the nullity, impossibility, and
falsity of the pretended Confessions of Witches themselves, and
therefore that no credit at all ought to be given unto them, and
however no Law nor Equity ought to allow the Evidence of a
Party, as in these cases all Witches are. And though some few of
them have been so exceedingly mad to make such false and absurd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Confessions, yet if the Records of all Ages and Courts were sought,
it will be found that many hundreds of them have suffered that never
confessed the least tittle of any such matter; and the supposed
Witches of <em>Salmesbury</em> in the County of <em>Lancaster</em>, the tenth year
of the Raign of King <em>James</em>, were so far from this confession, that
they were cleared, and the accusation found to be false, and all
acted by the imposture of one <em>Thompson</em>, or <em>Christopher Southworth</em>.
And I my self have known two supposed Witches to have been
put to death at <em>Lancaster</em> within these eighteen years, that did utterly
deny any such League, or ever to have seen any visible Devil
at all: and may not the confession of these (who both dyed penitently)
be as well credited, as the confessions of those that were
brought to such confessions by force, fraud, or cunning perswasion,
and allurements? But if there be any such League or Covenant betwixt
the Witches and the Devil, how cometh the truth of this
matter of fact (if ever there were or could be any such thing) to
be certainly known and revealed? Have any of the Pen-men of
the holy Scriptures recorded, that there ever was, is, or can be any
such League or Contract? Or was it ever attested by any honest
rational men, that were ear or eye-witnesses of such a bargain and
contract? Therefore we must once again conclude: <i><span lang="la">De non apparentibus
&#38; non existentibus eadem est ratio</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 10.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>10. As for the Witches either Males or Females, having carnal
Copulation with Devils, either as an <em>Incubus</em> or <em>Succubus</em>, and
their stealing of seed from a man, and conveying it into the vessels
of the woman, it is in it self so horrid, monstrous, and incredible, that
I cannot well believe him to be a rational person, or <i><span lang="la">sanæ mentis</span></i>,
that believes it as a truth, and therefore cannot but think the rehearsal
of it a sufficient confutation. Also herein I do appeal to
all learned Physicians, who do know the way that Nature breeds
humane seed, the causes that make it prolifical, and the members
fit for its generation and reception, who (I doubt not) will deride
this Tenent, and condemn it, as false and abominable. Moreover,
the horrid absurdity of it hath been sufficiently demonstrated by
<em>Wierus</em>, Dr. <em>Tandlerus</em>, Mr. <em>Scot</em>, Mr. <em>Wagstaff</em>, and others: and
therefore all we shall say is this: “That Devils, whether conceived
to be corporeal or incorporeal, and to assume bodies (for the
one it must of necessity be) were not created of God to generate,
neither have they, nor can have any seed, or members fit
for generation; and therefore to copulate or generate is derogatory
from the glory of Nature, and blasphemous against God
and his Power.” As for the Devils sucking the Teats, Warts, or
such like excrescences of the Witches bodies, we should have passed
it over as easily as the former, but only that Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> hath
taken up the Cudgels to defend it: to confute which, we shall give
these satisfactory Reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Pag.</em> 18.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. There can be no rational end assigned, why the Devil should
perform this action, for we must tell Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> that supposals are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>no proofs, and <i><span lang="la">ex suppositis supposita consequuntur</span></i>, and in a thing
of this nature, arguments to prove it probable are insufficient. And
if (as he confesseth) for their being suckt by the Familiar, I say,
(he saith) “We know so little of the Nature of Demons and Spirits,
that ’tis no wonder we cannot certainly divine the reason of
so strange an action”: Now if he knew so little of their Nature,
it must needs be vanity and arrogance to take upon him to declare
so much: and if he could not certainly divine the reason of so
strange an act, it was extreme folly and pride in him to bring in
idle and vain conjectures and probability, where verity and certainty
are expected. One while he supposeth them corporeal,
which if granted, will not prove that they are recreated by the
reeks and vapours of humane blood, because their bodies are of a
more pure Nature, than to be nourished with gross, and sometimes
(especially in melancholick old men and women) corrupted blood;
for if every thing be nourished by its like, then they cannot be fed
with humane blood, for they have no flesh nor bones such as ours,
that have need to be nourished with blood. And for his next,
<em>perhaps, and may be, that it is a diabolical Sacrament</em>, we shall believe
it when he proves it, and not before. But he hath a third
supposal, which to him seemeth most probable, <em>viz.</em> “That the
Familiar doth not only suck the Witch, but in the action infuseth
some poysonous ferment into her”. If this had been most probable,
why did he bring in the other two, that are less probable? surely
he might have known that, <i><span lang="la">frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest
per pauciora</span></i>. And is his sucking now come to infusion and injection?
surely these will not accord: but enough of supposals.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>History.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. But we must know of Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, how he comes to know
that the Devils sucking of the Witches bodies is a truth, or ever
was proved to be matter of fact, who were by and present that
were ear or eye-witnesses of it? A thing that never was proved
ought never to be believed; and if he recur to the Witches confessions,
that is fully overthrown before, and we are sure that in
these late years that are past, when so many pretended Witch-finders
were set abroad in <em>Scotland</em> and <em>Northumberland</em>, they never manifested,
nor could verifie any such thing, but were found and discovered
to be notorious Impostors and Knaves, pretending to discover
Witches by putting sharp Needles or Pins into the Warts
and hollow Excrescences of divers persons, when the persons so
dealt withal, did not see nor know; and if the persons did not
feel nor complain of pain, then (forsooth) they must be taken for
Witches, and be burnt. So of many persons they got money and
bribes, that they might not be searcht or stript naked, and of others
for finding Excrescences upon them that were hollow and
fistulous, and therefore when the Pin was thrust into the fistulous
cavity, that was skinned within, and so indolent, they were then
accounted guilty, and were either forced to compound with these
notorious pretended Witch-finders, or to be prosecuted for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>lives. By which wicked means and unchristian practices divers
innocent persons, both men and women lost their lives; and these
wicked Rogues wanted not greater persons (even of the Ministry
too) that did authorize and incourage them in these Diabolical
courses, as though this had been some way prescribed by God or
his Word to discover Witches by, when it was an Hellish device
of the Devil to delude Witchmongers, and bring poor innocent
people to danger and death. Yet it had prevailed further, if some
more wise Heads and Christian Hearts had not interposed, by whom
the Villany was detected, and the Impostors severely punished;
and that this is a most certain truth, hundreds yet living can witness
and testifie. And the like in my time and remembrance happened
here in <em>Lancashire</em>, where divers both men and women were
accused for supposed Witchcraft, and were so unchristianly, unwomenly,
and inhumanely handled, as to be stript stark naked, and
to be laid upon Tables and Beds to be searched (nay even in
their most privy parts) for these their supposed Witch-marks: so
barbarous and cruel acts doth diabolical instigation, working upon
ignorance and superstition, produce.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. But as this was never really proved <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, that the Devil
did suck upon the body of a supposed Witch, so the possibility of
it likewise can never be demonstrated. For whether a Spirit be
taken to be corporeal, or to assume a body, yet it neither hath nor
can have such a body as our Saviour did appear in after his Resurrection,
which was the same real and numerical body that he suffered
in, and was by the sense of seeing and feeling distinguished from
any bodies that Spirits can have and appear in, especially in solidity
and tangibility; for a Spirit hath not flesh and bones, as he
was felt and seen to have. And where there is no flesh and bones,
there cannot be any animal sucking, and we speak not here of artificial
sucking or attraction, of which there is a great question, whether
any such thing be at all or not; but however the Spirits have
no power to suck, because they have not flesh and bones.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. That there are divers Nodes, Knots, Protuberances, Warts,
and Excrescences that grow upon the bodies of men and women, is
sufficiently known to learned Physicians and experienced Chirurgions.
Some have them from their mothers wombs, some grow
afterwards, some proceed from internal causes, some from external
hurts, some are soft, some hard, some pendulous, some not, some
fistulous, and issue matter, some hollow and indolent, and many
other ways. And these are more frequent in some persons, by reason
of their Complexion and Constitution, in others by reason of
their Age, Sex, and other accidents and circumstances, especially
in Women that are old, and their accustomed purgations staid, or
by reason of Child-birth, and the like. Now if all these were
Witch-marks, then few would go free, especially those that are of
the poorer sort, that have the worst diet, and are but nastily kept.
And for their being indolent, it doth argue nothing but ignorance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>for many sorts of Tumors and Excrescences are without pain, as
well as fistulous and hollow Warts. And it is a woful errour, to
make that a sign and mark of a diabolical Contract, that hath natural
causes for its production. And it is a strange kind of Logick
to argue or conclude, that men or women are Witches, and have
made a Contract with the Devil, because they have such Warts or
Excrescences that are indolent when pricked into: where is the
coherence, connexion, or just consequence? Let all wise men
judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for that vain opinion, that Witches are, or can be really and
essentially transformed into Dogs, Cats, Hares, and the like, or men
transubstantiated into Wolves, it is largely by numerous positive arguments,
confuted by <em>Casmannus</em>, and by the Authors of that learned
Treatise of Spirits and Devils, written in the Raign of Queen
<em>Elizabeth</em>, as also by <em>Wierus</em>, Mr. <em>Scot</em>, and others; so that we shall
not bring all that others have written about this point, but note
such things as are most material, and have been less handled or regarded
by others, and that in these Particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It is taken to be a great matter with some, because St. <em>Augustin</em>
seemeth to favour this opinion of transformation, and tells us
this: <i><span lang="la">Si enim dixerimus ea non esse credenda, non desunt etiam nunc,
qui ejusmodi quædam, vel certissima audisse, vel etiam expertos se esse
asseverent</span></i>. And then saith: “And we, when we were in <em>Italy</em>, did
hear such things of a certain Region of those parts, where certain
Women that kept Inns, being skilled in these Arts (they did say)
were wont to give in Cheese to Travellers that they could get to
take it, whence forthwith they were turned into Juments,
and carried necessary burdens, and when they had done, did again
return unto themselves, but that while they had not a bestial,
but rational and humane understanding.” And yet concludeth:
<i><span lang="la">Hæc vel falsa sunt, vel tam inusitata, ut meritò non credantur</span></i>. To
which we shall return these short answers. 1. Though St. <em>Austin</em>
were in many things a very Learned man; yet being but a man,
might and did erre, not only in this point, but in many others.
2. His Reasons to prove it by are weak and groundless. 3. He
speaketh nothing of his certain and peculiar knowledge, but by
common fame and hear-say; and therefore the matters alledged to
be done, are not credible. 4. He confesseth that they are either
false, or so unusual, that they are not worthy to be believed.
5. And when he hath said all he can, he concludeth these Transformations
(if any such were) to be but phantastical, that is, to
seem so, but not really to be so, and what he meaneth by a phantastical
appearance, is not easie to judge, whether it were a delusion
of the Phantasie within, or of the senses without. 6. But in another
place he telleth us this: <i><span lang="la">Non est credendum, humanum corpus
Dæmonum arte vel potestate in bestialia lineamenta converti posse</span></i>;
so that here is St. <em>Austin</em> contradicting himself, or else he concludeth
nothing. 7. But his learned Commentator <em>Ludovicus Vives</em> doth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>not give credit to those vain and lying Fables, but confuteth them
by the Authority of Pliny (who might have given St. <em>Austin</em> satisfaction,
if he had read him) who tells us roundly: <i><span lang="la">Homines in lupos
verti, rursumq; restitui sibi, falsum esse confidenter existimare
debemus, aut credere omnia quæ fabulosa tot seculis comperimus</span></i>.

<p class='c008'>2. For essential Transformations we have examples in the Sacred
Scriptures, but these not wrought but by a divine Hand and
an omnipotent Power. And such was that of <em>Lots</em> Wife, who
looking back contrary to command, was turned into a Pillar of
Salt, <i><span lang="la">&#38; fuit in statuam salis</span></i>, as <em>Arias Montanus</em> renders it, which
accordeth with the Hebrew exactly, the vulgar Latine and others
say, <i><span lang="la">versa est in statuam salis</span></i>: and this by the divine finger was a
real transubstantiation, especially in respect of her body, the substance
of which was really changed into an absolute Pillar of Salt,
without regression or returning back to what it was before, but
remained so still, and was standing in the days of <em>Josephus</em>, if credit
may be given to what he writeth. Another example we have
in <em>Moses</em> his Rod, which God commanded him to cast upon the
ground, <em>and he cast it upon the ground, and it became a Serpent,
and Moses fled from before it. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put
forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand,
and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand.</em> This Rod afterwards
<em>Aaron</em> threw down before <em>Pharaoh, and it became a Serpent,
and swallowed up the rods of the Wise-men and Sorcerers, and it afterwards
became a rod again</em>, and <em>Aaron</em> used it in working some
of the rest of the Miracles. So that this was so true a transformation,
that <em>Moses</em> himself was afraid when he saw the Rod a Serpent,
that he fled from before it; and that it was a real change,
appeared in that it swallowed up the Rods of the Magicians, and
still afterwards became a Rod again. So likewise all the Waters
in <em>Egypt</em> were really changed into blood: And our Saviour did
really change the Water into Wine at the Marriage in <em>Cana</em> of <em>Galilee</em>.
And all these were true and real transubstantiations, which
neither Devils nor Witches can perform, as appeareth by these unanswerable
Arguments.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. All real Transubstantiations are wrought and performed by
a divine and omnipotent Power: but Devils and Witches have no
divine nor omnipotent Power. Therefore Devils or Witches cannot
work or perform any real Transubstantiations.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. All Beings that work real Transubstantiations, must work
contrary and different from that order and course that God hath
established in Nature: but Devils and Witches cannot work contrary
and different from that order and course that God hath established
in Nature. Therefore Devils and Witches cannot work any
real transubstantiations at all. Let all the Witchmongers in the
World answer these Arguments, if they be able.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>3. We find also external Transfiguration, as of Christ in the
Mountain; for the Text saith, in St. <em>Matthews</em> Gospel: <em>And he
was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the Sun, and
his raiment was white as the light</em>. And <em>Mark</em> saith: <em>And he was
transfigured before them, and his raiment became shining exceeding
white as snow: so as no fuller on earth can white them</em>. And St. <em>Luke</em>
saith: <em>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,
and his raiment was white and glittering</em>. The word used in those
places for the transfiguring or altering of his face by St. <em>Matthew</em>
and St. <em>Mark</em> is <span lang="grc">μετεμορφώθη</span>, from <span lang="grc">μετὰ</span> <em>trans</em>, and <span lang="grc">μορφὴ</span> <i><span lang="es">forma</span></i>, <em>figura</em>,
the outward form, shape, figure, or lineaments; and this word is
also used for the change or transforming of the mind, will, desires,
and affections: For so the Apostle saith: <em>And be not conformed
to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind</em>.
And again he saith: <em>We behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord
with open face: and are transformed into the same image from glory
to glory</em>. But St. <em>Luke</em> instead of this word expresseth it thus:
<span lang="grc">τὸ εἶδος τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἕτερον</span>. <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> renders it: <i><span lang="la">Transformatus
est aspectus vultûs ejus</span></i>. And <em>Beza</em>: <i><span lang="la">Species vultûs ejus alia</span></i>, which
is nearest the Greek. So <em>Moses</em> face, when he had been with
the Lord upon the Mount, the skin of it did shine, so that he put a
veil upon it, when he spoke to the people, and put it off when he
went in to speak unto the Lord. So that these were external alterations
of both Christs and <em>Moses</em> face, by appearing glorious, resplendent,
and shining like the Sun, and this was wrought by a divine
hand and power. From whence we may note,</p>

<p class='c008'>1. That though Christ was thus gloriously transformed (for so
the word doth bear) yet we are not to imagine, that Christ was
essentially changed into some other substance or nature; no, but
that he was rather made there most resplendent in glory.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. And where the Apostle wisheth the <em>Romans</em> to be transformed:
Is it to be essentially transformed into any other substance
or natural thing? Nay not so, but effectively into some other more
sacred qualities, by the renovation of their inward mind. And
again where he saith: <em>And are transformed into the same image
from glory to glory</em>. His meaning is not, that we are essentially
transformed into the very image of God; for so should he very
shrewdly confirm that foolish opinion of some, who hold that men
are deified in God, and that God also is hominified in men: But
his purpose is, that we (by the operation of the holy Spirit) should
proceed and grow (by degrees) from glory to glory, until we be
truly conformed unto the similitude of that same glorious Image of
God wherein we were first created; and so intendeth no essential
transformation at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. We are here to note the difference betwixt this Transfiguration,
and that which may proceed from natural causes, as passions,
affections, or diseases; and also from artificial or counterfeited
Transfigurations. For it is wonderful to behold, how anger and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>rage doth alter the faces and countenances of some, and so grief,
sorrow, despair, and the like, in others, causeth horrible changes
all over the external parts both of the face and body. Neither is
any passion more prevalent than deep-rooted fear mixed with despair,
as hath been manifested in some, that in a short time, nay
even in the space of one night have had their hair, that formerly
was black, turned into gray or white, as is testified by Authors of
unquestionable veracity. And for diseases, it is almost incredible
to think, what strange alterations Madness, Frenzy, the bitings of a
mad Dog, Melancholies (especially that kind which Physicians call
<em>Lycanthropia</em>, which is so wonderful, that it hath made many dotingly
believe, they were really transformed) will produce and
bring forth. Examples of which at large may be seen in <em>Schenckius</em>;
of which we shall speak more fully anon, as also of artificial and
counterfeited Transfigurations: and that Devils nor Witches can
perform no such Transfigurations as this of Christ and <em>Moses</em>, is manifest
by the Arguments laid down before, because these were
brought to pass by a divine Hand and an omnipotent Power, which
Devils and Witches have not, and therefore cannot operate any
such things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 7. 31.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. Moreover in the Scripture there is mention of counterfeit,
simulated, and hypocritical transformation, such the Apostle mentioneth
in these words, speaking of the false Apostles: <em>For such are
false Apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the
Apostles of Christ</em>. And no marvel, for Satan himself <em>is</em> transformed
into an Angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing, if his
Ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of Righteousness,
whose end shall be according to their works. The word there
thrice used is from <span lang="grc">μετασχηματίζω</span>, which cometh from <span lang="grc">ἕχω</span> <i><span lang="la">habeo, possideo,
teneo</span></i>, and from thence <span lang="grc">σχῆμα</span> <i><span lang="la">habitus</span></i>: so that the compound
Verb properly signifieth <em>effingo, assimulo</em>, and so of necessity must
signifie in these three places. So the Apostle saith in another
place: <em>The form of this world</em>, <span lang="grc">σχῆμα</span>, <em>passeth away</em>, that is, the fashion,
condition, custom, or usage of the world passeth away. This
place of Scripture concerning Satans transforming of himself into
an Angel of light (though plain in it self) hath been and still is
most usually alledged by Witchmongers, to prove the Apparitions
of Devils by: For thus they commonly argue; “If Satan can transform
himself into an Angel of Light; much more (arguing <i><span lang="la">à
majore ad minus</span></i>) into any other shape, and so may easily appear in
the form of a Cat, Dog, or in any other shape whatsoever”, and
this they think to be an invincible Argument. This way of argument
were of force, if the Apostle in this place had meant or
intended any real or essential transformation; but that this is not
the meaning of the Text, we shall prove by these following Reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Joh. 12. 5, 6.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. The very signification of the word here, doth not bear nor
intend any essential transformation; but only feigning, pretending,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and assimulating, as when <em>Judas</em> pretended charity and love to the
poor, when he said: <em>Why was not this oyntment sold for three hundred
pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared
for the poor: but because he was a thief and had the bag, and bare
what was put therein.</em> Though <em>Judas Iscariot</em> hypocritically feigned
and pretended this charity to, and care for the poor, yet was
he not really a charitable man, or a lover of the poor, but a thief,
and a most covetous wretch. So these false Apostles did pretend
much zeal and piety to preach and promote the Gospel, but therefore
were they not really transformed and changed into true Apostles,
but were Deceivers, Dissemblers, and Hypocrites. So Satan
often pretendeth heavenly, angelical, and divine things, and to do
as the holy Angels do; but it is in deceit, cozenage, falsity, and hypocrisie,
and so he is by counterfeiting and dissembling said to be
transformed into an Angel of Light, and not otherwise by any essential
transformation at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. The Text it self doth plainly manifest, that they were not
transformed into true Apostles, for then St. <em>Paul</em> had had no cause
to have written so bitterly against them; but that notwithstanding
that shew, form, or pretence that they held forth, and though outwardly
they seemed to personate the true Apostles of Christ, yet
that was but an external and hypocritical simulation; for really and
truly they were false Apostles, <span lang="grc">ψευδαπόστολοι</span>, and deceitful workers,
<span lang="grc">ἐργάται δόλιοι</span>. And so Satan may make what shews or pretences he
will of goodness, piety, and of heavenly things, and so may counterfeit,
dissemble and lye, yet still he remaineth a very accursed
Devil, and is never really changed from his damned and diabolical
Nature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 3.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Dialog. Disc. of Spirits and Devils, p. 234.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. Satan is so transformed into an Angel of Light, as his Ministers
are transformed into the Apostles of Christ. But Satans Ministers
are not essentially transformed into the Apostles of Christ.
Therefore neither is Satan essentially transformed into an Angel of
Light. For though Satans Ministers may pretend never so much
piety and zeal, and labour to personate and imitate the true Ministers
of Christ, yet notwithstanding that pretended transformation,
they still really and essentially remain as they were, that is, Deceivers
and Hypocrites. And Satan for all his seeming and apparent
personating and imitating the Angels of Light, he still remaineth
in his essence and nature an Angel of Darkness, and a lying and
accursed Wretch.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>August. de Civ. Dei</em>, <em>l.</em> 2. <em>c.</em> 26.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. The Devil is never nor can be really and essentially transubstantiated
into an Angel of Light, for then he could (indeed and
in truth) be no longer a Devil, but his diabolical Nature would of
necessity cease. But all his transformation is, when he intendeth
most deeply to circumvent and deceive the sons of men, then he
pretendeth the most religious and the holiest shews of all. Pretending
in all outward appearance the holy affections, sincerity, and
zeal of the holiest Angels of Light. For as St. <em>Austin</em> saith: “Unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the malignity of Satan be sleightly and cunningly covered,
his deceivable purpose is seldom or never effected.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 5.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Chrysost. in loc.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. The best and most sound Expositors, both ancient, middle,
and modern do expound the place as we have urged it, of which
we shall name only two or three. St. <em>Chrysostom</em> tells us this: <i><span lang="la">Operarii
dolosi: nam operantur quidem, sed revellunt ea quæ sunt plantata:
nam quoniam sciunt se aliter non posse esse acceptos, personâ
veritatis sumptâ, erroris actum simulantes peragunt</span></i>. And a little after
he saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Et multos Diabolus sic decipit, personâ in se acceptâ,
&#38; non factus Angelus lucis: sic illi personam Apostolorum circumferunt,
non ipsam potentiam, neq; fortes sunt</span></i>. Dr. <em>Hammond</em> gives
the Paraphrase of this place thus: “For the truth is (he saith)
these men that come to infuse false Doctrines into you, behave
themselves as cunningly as they can, and do labour to imitate,
and seem to do those very things, that we true Apostles do. And
’tis no unusual matter for Deceivers and Seducers to do so; for
Satan himself pretends to do those things that the good Angels
do, makes as if he meant you all kindness, when he comes to destroy
you. And therefore ’tis not any thing strange, if seducing
Hereticks, imployed by him, do imitate the actions of the Apostles
of Christ; but according to the hypocrisie of their actions,
so shall their ends be.” See <em>Theophylact</em> and <em>Calvin</em> upon the place.
So that we positively conclude, that from this place of Scripture no
real or essential transformations of Devils can be proved at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. There are natural Transformations by progression to perfection,
as is manifest in Insects, which at the first to our view do
appear to be Worms, Maggots, Creepers, or Caterpillers, and yet
afterwards do become several sorts of winged Creatures, as Butterflies
of many and various kinds, Flies, and the like; as that Creature,
which here in the North Fishers do call a <em>May</em>-Fly, is first but
a little Creeper inclosed in an Hull, as of pieces of straws, or the
like: and so that which they call a Cod-bait, is like a yellow Maggot
with a black head inclosed in a sandy crustaceous Husk, and
yet towards the middle of <em>August</em>, or the beginning of <em>September</em>
becometh a fine yellowish Fly, which the Fishers use to bait withal,
and these are but gradual progressions towards the perfection of the
Animalcle, as the learned Author <em>Johannes Swammerdanus</em> hath
declared in these words, as we find it laid down in the Philosophical
Transactions: “First it lays down the ground of all natural
changes in Insects; declaring, that by the word Change, is nothing
else to be understood but a gradual and natural evolution
and growth of the parts, not any Metamorphosis or Transformation
of them, and a great deal more of notable observations concerning
the most sorts of Insects, as may be seen in the piece quoted
in the Margent.” So likewise there are very many strange
transformations wrought by petrifactions both of Vegetables and
Animals, or their parts, as may be seen by the Writings of many
learned Authors, especially those noted in the Margent, to whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>we refer the curious Inquirer. These being natural Transfigurations
(for so they may be properly called) we cannot rationally
suppose that any man of judgment will imagine, that any such can
be produced by Devils or Witches, because they are brought forth
by natural Principles and Agents, which Devils or Witches cannot
overrule, alter, nor hinder, else the whole and certain course that
the Creator hath set in the order of the production and generation
of natural things, might be suspended, which is not possible
to be performed without an omnipotent Power, which the Devils
and Witches have not. Besides the most of these require a suitable
time for their production and perfection, which must only be
performed by the internal operation of Nature, or by Art accelerating
the works of Nature, which Devils and Witches cannot
bring to pass.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. There are divers other Transformations (at least so accounted
and called) which because they are not absolutely pertinent to
our purpose, we shall only mention slightly. 1. External changes
of the body in respect of diseases, and some by an extraordinary
power, as that of <em>Moses</em>, to whom the Lord said: <em>Put now thine
hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: And
when he took it out: behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And
he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again: And he put his hand
into his bosom again, and plucked it out of his bosom, and behold,
it was turned again as his other flesh.</em> Here we see that the same
hand was made leprous white as snow, and was again restored as
his other flesh. And this was done by a divine Power, such as neither
Devils nor Witches can perform. So <em>Gehazi</em> of whom it is
said: <em>The leprosie therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper
as white as snow.</em> And here the judgment was permanent, and
no restauration, and was a great Miracle, which Devils and Witches
cannot perform. 2. There is feigned, and artificial transfigurations.
So of <em>David</em>, of whom it is said: <em>And he changed his behaviour
before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrambled
on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard</em>.
And all this he prudently feigned, that he might escape from <em>Achish</em>
the King of <em>Gath</em>, of whom he was sore afraid: So many Persons of
Worth have disguised themselves strangely, that they might escape
the hands of their enemies, or not fall into their power, and yet
these were not done by the Devils Art, nor by Witchcraft. So a
Stage-player transfigureth himself, sometimes to personate one person,
and sometimes another; and though his outward habit, speech,
and action be changed, yet he remaineth the same in Nature and
Person that he was before those changes, and so maketh nothing
for Witchcraft at all. 3. There are knavish Transfigurations and
Counterfeiting for deceitful and wicked ends, as in those we call
Gypsies, that discolour their faces and skins, to be more fit to cheat
and cozen. So likewise do many other vile and wicked persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>counterfeit Sores, Ulcers, Leprosie, Dropsie, and such like diseases,
as may be seen at large in <em>Ambrose Paræus</em> Book of Monsters, and
we have seen and detected divers; and all this done only to deceive
and abuse mens goodness and charity: But no more of Devil
in any of these, but the wickedness of the mind, and the evil
of the end and intention. Of a more wicked grain and temper are
those, that for wicked and devilish ends counterfeit themselves to
be possessed, and labour to make the World believe, that the Devil
doth move in divers parts of their bodies, and doth speak in
them, when it is nothing but only their own devilish cunning in
lying and counterfeiting, as we shall have occasion to shew more
fully hereafter. 4. There are also divers kinds of sportive and delusive
Transformations, performed by those that use the Art of Leger-de-main
or Juggling, wherein they pretend and seem to transubstantiate
one thing into another, when by the agility of their
hands, and the gesture of their face and body, they do but draw
your eyes and attention another way, while they do but nimbly
convey another thing in its place. And he that taketh these for
Conjurers or Witches, and their Tricks for diabolical or Witchcraft,
are surely under a devilish delusion, and are most strangely
bewitched. And as for the changes wrought by <em>Pharaohs</em> Magicians,
we shall particularly handle it in another place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>vers.</em> 16.</div>

<p class='c008'>8. There are other Transformations mentioned in the Scripture,
of which we shall now speak. 1. That transformation that the
Grace and Spirit of God doth work inwardly in the minds and
hearts of the Godly, which is not by changing their Nature or
Persons, but by transforming their minds, and altering their wills
and affections from sinful and earthly things, to those that are holy
and heavenly: so the Apostle willeth the <em>Romans, that they be
transformed by the renewing of their minds</em>, and so they come to
be changed from glory to glory, and this were blasphemy to say,
that either Devil or Witch could perform it. 2. There is a transformation
wrought in the minds of the wicked by the just judgment
of God; for the Text saith, speaking of Antichrist: <em>Revealing
even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all
power and signs and lying wonders. And with all deceivableness
of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the
love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause
God shall send them strong delusions, that they should believe a lye.
That they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness.</em> So in the case of <em>Saul</em> the Text saith:
<em>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil Spirit from God
came upon Saul</em>. These therefore are inward judgments for wickedness,
sent by God by the ministry of Satan, of which we shall
speak more hereafter. 3. We lastly come to the main point, that
is, concerning the transformation of <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>, which the
Witchmongers hold to be a real and an essential transubstantiation,
therefore let us hear the words as they run in our English Translation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>which are this: <em>And they shall drive thee from men, and thy
dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, they shall make thee
eat grass as oxen. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar,
and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as
oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs
were grown like Eagles feathers, and his nails like birds claws. And
at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lift up mine eyes unto
heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me. At the same
time my reason returned unto me.</em> And a little before: <em>Let his heart
be changed from mans, and let a beasts heart be given unto him</em>.
From this place they commonly frame an argument to this purpose.
That <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> being really and essentially changed from a
man to a beast or an ox, much more may Satan essentially transform
himself into the shape of any Creature, and consequently that he
may really change the Witches into Hares, Dogs, Cats, and the
like. But we shall unanswerably prove that the assumption is
false, that <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> was not transubstantiated, or essentially
transformed at all: And if he had been really so, yet that the consequence
is invalid, and of no force, and that by these Arguments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. medic.</em> <em>l.</em> 4. <em>c.</em> 5. <em>p.</em> 239.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Because that being driven into the field, and eating grass as
oxen, and having his body (it was his body, not the body of an
oxe, and therefore no corporeal nor real change) wet with the
dew of Heaven, do not at all conclude or infer, that his body was
really and essentially changed, nor in the external figure of it altered
from what it was before; for he might go upon all four, and
eat grass, and yet that doth argue no real change of his bodily
shape at all; for so have divers persons done, that being young,
have been lost in Woods and Desarts, and have been brought up
with Bears or Wolves. To which purpose take one story for all
from <em>Philip Camerarius</em>, that learned Counsellor of <em>Norimberg</em>, a
man of great credit and reputation, in these words. “In the year
1543. there was in the parts of <em>Hesse</em> a Lad taken, who (as he
reported afterwards, and so it was found true) when he was but
three years old, was taken away, and afterwards nourished and
brought up by Wolves. These Wolves, when they got any prey,
would always bring the best of it to a Tree, and give it to the
Child, which did eat it: in Winter and time of cold, they would
dig a pit, and strew it with grass and leaves of trees, and thereupon
lay the Child, and lying round about it, preserve him from
the injury of the weather: after they would make him go upon
all four, and run with him, till by use and length of time, he
could skip and run like a Wolf; being taken, he was compelled
by little and little to go only upon his feet. He would often
say, that if it had been in his power, he could have taken more
delight to have conversed among Wolves, than among men: he
was carried to the Court of <em>Henry Lantgrave</em> of <em>Hesse</em> to be seen.”
And in the same Chapter he relateth another story to the same
purpose of one that he himself had known and seen, that was of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>admirable agility, and more to the same end. Now must we conclude,
that because this Boy did live and lye in the open air, was
fed with raw flesh, and went upon all four, that therefore he was
really and essentially charged into a Wolf? no, that would be inconsequent
and ridiculous; and so would it be, if because <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>
lay in the open field, was wet with the rain and dew,
and did eat grass as an ox, to conclude, that therefore he was really
changed into a beast; the absurdities are both alike. This is
as mad a kind of inference, as if we should say, Conies and Geese
do eat grass like an Ox, therefore they are Oxen or Asses, when
notwithstanding they still retain their essential beings and shapes,
without any essential transformations at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Because the hairs of his head (as the Text saith) were grown
like to an Eagles feathers, and for that also the very nails of his
hands and feet were like the claws of a bird: yet it doth not
prove that he was really changed into a beast, and that for these
Reasons. 1. Because it would be more consonant to conclude,
that he was rather transformed into some bird, having feathers and
claws, than into a beast that hath horns and hoofs, though there was
in him no corporeal transformation at all, but only a changed mind.
2. The Text is not according to the Hebrew Phrase used when
there is real transubstantiation, as in <em>Lots</em> Wife; <i><span lang="la">Et fuit statua salis</span></i>;
but as <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> renders it: <i><span lang="la">Usquedum pili ejus ut Aquilarum plumæ
crevissent, &#38; ungues ejus ut avium</span></i>. And <em>Arias Montanus</em> thus:
<i><span lang="la">Donec capillus ejus sicut Aquilarum crevit, &#38; ungues ejus sicut avium</span></i>:
which is exactly agreeable to the Hebrew. So that the
assertion is not, that his hairs were changed into Eagles feathers,
nor his nails into birds claws, but that they were <i><span lang="la">sicut</span></i> as the feathers
of Eagles, and as the claws of birds; the hairs by being
grown ruffled, squalid, and rugged, and the nails by being grown
long, hard, and crooked for want of cutting, dressing, combing,
and ordering; and more change than this the words or sense do not
bear. 3. There was no other change, but what was by natural
growth; for the Hebrew word <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>רָבָה</span><a id='t92'></a> doth properly signifie <i><span lang="la">multus
fuit, succrevit in multitudinem</span></i>: so that the hairs were increased
naturally in multitude and length, and the nails in magnitude and
length, and so there was no essential change at all, but only an excessive
augmentation of them both, he having lost the use of reason,
whereby he could not use means to cut, cleanse, and order
them. So that they did but grow squalid and ill-favour’d for want
of using means to order and make them comely, even as many that
have been lost, or left in Desarts, and desolate places, have after
some length of time been found to be overgrown with hairs and
ugly nails, that they have scarce been taken for men, but have appeared
as savage and feral Monsters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Palon.</em> <i><span lang="la">in loc.</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>3. His restauration doth plainly testifie what kind of change it
was; for that which was restored unto him, did bring him into
the same condition that he was in, before this transformation; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>that was his knowledge or understanding. Now therefore if his
knowledge or understanding did reduce him to the right use of
reason, and brought those conditions and qualities that he had before:
Then it is most plain, that it was only his knowledge or
understanding that was taken away or changed; and so there was
no other transformation, but what was internal in the mind, judgment,
or imagination, by altering his will, desires, cogitations, condition,
and qualities, and so no essential transformation at all, nor
no change of his external shape, but what grew naturally in regard
of his hair and nails or skin, for want of due ordering and decent
dressing. And that this is an unanswerable truth, the words in the
Text do sufficiently testifie, which are in our English: <em>And mine
understanding returned unto me, and at the same time my reason
returned unto me</em>; therefore it was only his understanding and reason,
that had for a time been turned from him, and at his restauration
they returned, or came again. <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> renders the former
Verse: <i><span lang="la">Et mente meâ ad me reversâ Excelso benedixi</span></i>. And in the
latter: <em>Mente meâ reversâ in me</em>. In both Verses <em>Arias Montanus</em>
renders it: <i><span lang="la">Cognitio mea super me reversa est</span></i>; for the Hebrew
word there used <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>יָדַע</span><a id='t93'></a> <i><span lang="la">scivit, restituit, cognovit, agnovit, propriè est
mentis &#38; intellectûs</span></i>, as <em>Avenarius</em> saith. And the Septuagint in
both the Verses do agree with the Hebrew, <span lang="grc">αἱ φρένες μου ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ἐπεσρόφησαν</span>.
And to this purpose doth the French, Italian, and Luthers
Translation render it, only the vulgar Latine gives it by the word
<i><span lang="la">sensus, &#38; figura mea reversa est</span></i>, which is altogether vicious. So that
from hence we may safely conclude, that this transformation was
only internal and mental, and no essential change at all: of which
a most learned Divine tells us thus much: <i><span lang="la">Sunt nonnulli, inter quos
est Johannes Bodinus, qui putant humanam figuram reverà fuisse ei
ademptam. Ac sanè Deus pro sua omnipotentia miraculum hoc in
rege isto impio facere, &#38; humanam ejus naturam in bruti animalis
essentiam mutare potuit: sed verisimilius est regem alienatum mente,
vel etiam maniacum factum, ademptâ ei divinitùs mente, ut patet,
ex sequente vers. 34. &#38; in furorem versum, sive per iram, sive per
dolorem, ob acceptam ignominiam, quòd regiâ dignitate esset orbatus.

<p class='c008'>4. That this was only a mental and internal transformation, as
are many sorts of Melancholy, especially that which Physicians call
<em>Lycanthropia</em>, or <em>Melancholia lupina</em>, <em>Rabies canina</em>, and the like,
is most manifest by comparing it with some of these that we have
named; of which (though we have related some before) we shall
give some few, from Authors of credit and veracity. 1. And first
concerning the effects of that Madness caused by the biting of a
mad Dog, we have a most sad and deplorable story recited by <em>Philip
Salmuth</em>, that experienced Physician of <em>Anhalt</em>, which we shall
here give in English: “Many (he saith) do verily think that the
force of this poyson will break out, and appear within a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>months or years. But experience doth altogether testifie the
contrary. As certain learned Authors do commemorate, that
it hath laid hid in some the space of seven years, but in others it
hath broke forth in the twelfth. <em>Guainerius</em> also mentioneth a
certain person, to whom the <em>Hydrophobia</em> did happen the 18.
year after he was bitten by the mad Dog. Moreover (he continueth)
a most Noble person of <em>Hagen</em> hath told me, that a certain
Noble man was bitten in the face by a little pretty Dog, which
he much delighted in, and that the seeds of that poyson, as it
were nourished in his bosom for a long time, at the last did suddenly
break forth. For after that for some years feeling no molestation
nor trouble from that bite, he addressing himself to a
Virgin did marry. And the nuptial Supper being ended, and the
Bride brought to the Marriage-bed, her Kinsfolks a little after do
hear her complaining and lamenting. At which they laughed and
jested, thinking it but to be the Venereal sport. But that howling
continuing late, they by force do break the barred doors of the
Chamber, and enter, and find that the Bridegroom had bitten
with his teeth, plainly after the manner of a Dog, the face of the
Bride, and also the shoulders and arms, and the fleshy places, and
still did not give over the same sort of biting. Being much astonished
with this sad spectacle and cruel wickedness, they with an
ireful and provoked mind do forthwith slay him: and the new
Bride also died the same day.” Though this he had but by relation,
yet it was from a person of great quality; and if he had not
been reasonably assured of the truth of it, he would never have
writ it down amongst his Medical Observations. But this is also attested
by other Authors of sufficient credit, of divers of this sort of
persons, that have both barked and bitten like Dogs, and this is
testified by <em>Scribonius Largus</em> and <em>Rhases</em>, as <em>Baptista Codronchus</em>
hath cited them; and learned <em>Sennertus</em> tells us this: “That some
(if bitten with Dogs) do bark like Dogs, and flye at whomsoever
they meet, and that against or besides their will. For (he
saith) <em>Gentilis</em> relateth in his Comment upon <em>Avicen</em>, that a certain
young man troubled with this rabiousness, did exhort his
Mother, that she should not come near him, for he could not contain
himself but bite those that came near him.” 2. As concerning
Wolf-melancholy, we shall only give a short relation or two,
the first from <i><span lang="la">Donatus ab alto mari</span></i>, who confesseth that he had
seen two: of the one of which he saith: “This person (he saith)
having formerly known me, did one day meet me when he was
holden with this distemper; but I truly fearing went aside, and he
looking at me a little went away. There was with him a multitude
of men, and he did bear upon his shoulders a whole thigh
and a leg of a dead man: At last being cured he was well, who
afterwards when he met me again, did ask me, if I had not been
afraid, when he found me in such a place when he was mad: by
which it is manifest, that in him the memory was not vitiated.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Another take from that able Physician of <em>Delfe Petrus Forestus</em> in
English thus: “A certain Countryman was in the Spring-time
seen at <em>Alemaria</em> with an horrid look, and mad, to stay about
the Church-yard, and after to enter the Church, and did leap
upon a Seat or Plank (as we have seen him) only climbing upwards,
and another while downwards with great fury, and never
resting in one place. He carried a long staff in his hand, but did
strike no body, but did with it beat off the Dogs; for he had
his thighs and legs black and ulcered with black cruds or scurff
by the biting of Dogs. His whole body did appear squalid, very
black, and melancholick, but pale in the face, and his eyes exceeding
hollow. From the foresaid signs (he saith) I did judge
the man affected with the <em>Lycanthropia</em> or wolfish Melancholy. He
never used any Physician that I know of.” And this both this Author,
<em>Schenckius</em> and <em>Sennertus</em> do sufficiently confirm from <em>Paulus</em>,
<em>Aetius</em>, <em>Avicen</em>, and the like. From all which it is clear and manifest,
that <em>Nebuchadnezzars</em> distemper was but as some kind of
Melancholy, whereby the imagination was corrupted, and the use
of reason and right understanding for the time taken quite away,
as saith the Text: <em>Let his heart be changed from mans, and let a
beasts heart be given unto him</em>. That is, let his thoughts, desires,
and affections be made brutish; for by the heart in Scriptures the
cogitations, will, and affections are understood, as, <em>my son give me
thy heart</em>, that is, the love and affections of thy soul and heart. So
that when it is said, <em>Let a beasts heart be given him</em>, that is, let his
mind, thoughts, and affections be made bestial; and so there was
a change of the conditions and qualities of his mind and heart, but
no real or essential change of his natural heart at all. And in this
sense <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> doth take it, saying: <i><span lang="la">obbrutescat, nihil humanum
sapiat</span></i>, and so doth <em>Polanus</em>, <em>Rollock</em>, and others understand it; for
<em>Polanus</em> saith: <i><span lang="la">Debuisse animum ejus prorsus obbrutescere, &#38; mentem
judiciúmq; animi humani amittere: non enim intelligendum
hoc de metamorphosi aliqua in corpore facta, sed de animo tantùm
obbrutescente</span></i>. So that from these examples it appeareth, that many
persons, by reason of Melancholy in its several kinds, have been
mentally and internally (as they thought, being depraved in their
imaginations) changed into Wolves and other kind of Creatures,
and have acted their parts, as though they had been really so, when
the change was only in the qualities and conditions of the mind,
and not otherwise. And so only was the change of <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>,
which notwithstanding <em>Bodinus</em>, the Popish Writers, and
Witchmongers have falsely and ignorantly taken it to be a real
transubstantiation, when it was only mental: so apt are men to mistake
and urge things amiss, when it lyes for their own gain or interest.
But if these persons that thought themselves really changed
into Wolves, had been covered with a Wolfes skin fitted to their
bodies, and gone upon all four, and so have acted the parts of
Wolves, then it might in all likelihood have more strongly induced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>them to have believed a real transmutation indeed, though
that way neither had there been any change of substance, but
only a counterfeit and cunning disguisement: of which we shall
here insert (for diversion sake) a pleasant story from the Pen of
<em>Vincent le Blanc</em> of <em>Marseilles</em>, and leave it to be judged of according
to the credit of the Author, which runs thus: “As concerning
the <em>Anthropolychi</em>, I have not heard (he saith) of any thing
so strange, as that the Governor of <em>Bagaris</em>, related once to me.
He told me, that going with some of his Company from <em>Lionac</em>
to <em>Montpelier</em>, they overtook an old man with a Sack on his shoulders,
going a great pace towards the same Town, a Gentleman
of the Company out of charity told him, if he would, one of his
Servants, to ease him, should carry his burden for him: at first
he seemed unwilling to be troublesom; but at length accepted
the offer, and a Servant of the Commanders Chamber called <em>Nicholas</em>
took the burden, and being late, every one doubled his
pace, that they might get in in good time, telling the good old
man, they would go before, and he should find them at the <em>White
Horse</em>. The Servant of the Chamber coming in with the first, had
a curiosity to see what was in the Sack, where he found a Wolfes
skin, so properly accommodated for the purpose, that he had a
strong fancy to disguise himself in it: whereupon he got it upon
his back, and put his head within the Head-piece of the Skin, as
’twere to shew his Masters a Masquerade; but immediately a fury
seized him, that in the Hall where they supped, he made straight
to the Company at Table, and falling on them with teeth and
nails, made a dangerous rude havock, and hurt two or three of
them, so as the Servants and others fled to their Swords, and
so plyed the Wolf with wounds, that they laid him on the ground,
and hurt in several places. But as they looked upon him, they
were amazed when they saw under the Skin a poor Youth wallowing
in blood. They were fain to lay him presently on a Bed,
taking order for his wounds and hurts, whereof he was recovered;
and was long before he could be cured: But this cured him of
the like curiosity against another time. The Company by this
means had but a bad seasoned Supper, and many of them were
sick either of hurt or apprehension. For the old man Wolf, ’twas
not known what became of him; but ’tis probable, that hearing
of this tidy accident, he was cautious to appear.” Now if this
relation be true, as there is nothing in it that seems either impossible
or improbable, but that it might, then from it we may observe
these two things. 1. To consider for what end the skin of the
Wolf was so fitted and prepared, which might be to act some part
of a Tragedy or Comedy in, or in sport to fright some persons withal;
but then it is not likely, but that the old man would have appeared
and sought for it again, which he might have done without
fear or danger. But I rather conjecture it was for some more pernicious
purpose, as in that disguise to fright Travellers and Passengers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>that thereby they might (for without doubt the old man had
other Companions) more securely rob them, and so escape, and
not be discovered or apprehended, which might make him afraid
to be seen, or to seek it again. 2. We may note the curiosity of
the young man, and the strength of his fancy, being moved to see
himself, so fitly to appearance, to be so like a Wolf, and not to the
steams flowing from the Wolfes skin to work upon his imagination,
which we leave to the inquisition of Naturalists, that live in
Countries where Wolves are, to make tryal of.</p>

<p class='c008'>So having sufficiently disproved their supposition or assumption,
that <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> was essentially transformed into a beast, we
shall also shew the consequence that (if it had been true) they
would draw from it, to wit, that if <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> were really
transformed into a beast, much more may the Devil transform himself
into the shape of any Creature, and may change Witches into
Cats, Dogs, Hares, and the like, which can by no true Rules of
Argument be good, because it stands upon divers, or rather contrary
efficients, namely God and the Devil. The one having of
himself an absolute and indeterminate power, and therefore of himself
able to work what he will, where, when, and howsoever best
pleaseth himself. And so by consequence he might (if it had so
seemed good in his wisdom) have essentially transformed <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>
into an ox. The other (the Devil I mean) he hath
only a finite and limited power, and therefore utterly unable of
himself to accomplish any one work beyond the bounds of that
power: and so by consequence he cannot possibly transform himself
essentially into any Creature whatsoever, without a special
power from God. Lastly we shall conclude all with this binding
Argument: what transubstantiations soever are wrought, the thing
transformed ceases to be what it was before, both in nature, and
properties, as <em>Lots</em> Wife being transubstantiated into a Pillar of
Salt, did cease to be flesh, blood, and bones, as she was before, and
lost all the properties of humane Nature. So if Devils or Witches
be transubstantiated into other Creatures, they cease to be what
they were before both in Nature and Properties. And then by
consequence the Devil should cease to be a Devil in Nature and
Properties, and the Witches should cease to have humane Nature
and Properties in them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having laid down these positive Arguments, we shall in the next
place shew the horrid absurdities of these Tenents, to wit, of holding
a visible Contract, that the Devil sucks upon the Witches bodies,
that they have carnal Copulation together, or that they are
essentially changed into Cats, Dogs, or Hares, or that they can flye
in the air, or raise storms or tempests, and kill men or Cattel, and
the like, and that in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. These Tenents do derogate from the Wisdom and Power of
God in his Government of the World by divine Providence, because
by these it is supposed that the Devils and Witches do operate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>what, when, and howsoever it pleaseth them, and so the life
and estate of all Creatures should be in their power to afflict, torment,
or to destroy when they please, which is both false and
blasphemous. For the Devils and wicked men are enemies and rebels
against God, but yet conquered, and imprisoned, and chained
close up by his Almighty Power, that they are not able to act any
thing at all (except the evil of their own wills) nor put that into
execution, but as far as God doth license and order them, which
we shall make plain in these two particulars. 1. <em>The Devils are
kept, in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great day</em>, that
is, though their wills be corrupt, wicked, and evil, and that they
have a continual desire, <em>like a roaring lion, to seek whom they may
devour</em>; yet are they restrained from acting this evil, by the mighty
Power of God, and can execute nothing at all, but only as far as
God doth order and command them: so the Devils could not by
their own power enter into the herd of Swine, until Christ gave
to them leave: neither could Satan hurt <em>Job</em> either in his goods or body
(though he strongly and earnestly desired it) until he had leave
and commission given him from God. No more can Devils or
Witches perform these things that are pretended; for it can never
be proved that ever God did, or will give them order or leave
to perform any such filthy or wicked thing, for which there can be
no reason or end assigned why God should order such things to be
done, so far different and opposite to the rules of his Justice, Wisdom,
and Providence. 2. Nor can wicked persons act what they
please, but God doth bridle and restrain them as he pleaseth; for
though <em>Pilate</em> proudly thought and boasted that he had power
to condemn Christ, or to let him loose, yet our Saviour tells him:
<em>Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given
thee from above</em>. Upon which place learned Dr. <em>Hammond</em> saith
thus: “So that thou hast neither right nor power to inflict any
punishment on me, were it not that God, who is my Father,
hath in his great Wisdom and divine Counsels, for most glorious
ends, for the good of the World, determined to deliver me up
into thy power to suffer death under thee.” Of which another
saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Verba hæc duobus modis accipi possunt: partim quia
omnis potestas est à Deo, &#38; divinâ ordinatione; partim quia qui
cum potestate est, nihil planè potest, nisi ex Dei efficaci dispensatione
ac providentia</span></i>. So this is manifest in the excessive pride and boasting
of <em>Sennacherib</em> of his own power, and taking no notice of
Gods inevitable Decree in his Providence, that it was he, even the
Lord of Hosts that had done it, and of ancient times had formed
it, without which <em>Sennacherib</em> could have done nothing; but because
he despised Gods Power and Providence, therefore saith the
Lord: <em>Therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in
thy lips, and I will turn thee back, by the way by which thou camest</em>,
which was performed by the slaughter of his Army, and the sending
him back into his own Country: so little do mens purposes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and counsels prevail, when the Lords will and purpose are against
them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Absurd. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. These Tenents do divert and obstruct the power and practice
of Godliness: For while the Saints of God are taught, <em>that they are
to fight the good fight of Faith</em>; and if they intend to be crowned,
they must fight stoutly, and gain the victory, knowing, <em>that they
fight not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness in
high places, and that therefore they are to take unto them the whole
Armour of God</em>: Therefore they knowing that this warfare is spiritual,
and against spiritual enemies, and that the weapons both
offensive and defensive are also spiritual; therefore they ought always
spiritually to watch and stand upon their guard, lest their subtile
and cruel enemy the Devil take them unawares, or by his Stratagems
surprize them. For he is that old crafty Serpent, that hath
innumerable wiles, and while he intendeth one thing, he pretendeth
another; and like a cunning Enemy, gives a false Alarm at the
one side of the Camp, while he assaulteth another, or making false
fires or shews he seemeth to march away, when in the dark of the
night he intendeth to fall on. So lest the Christian should be
watchful and prevail, he laboureth by false Teachers, which are
the Magicians and Sorcerers in the Mystery, to draw them from
their vigilancy, by possessing their minds with these lying Tenents,
that the Devil comes in the shape of a Cat or a Dog to a Witch,
and bargains with her, and the rest, that whilst they are set at
gaze to look for him in a bodily shape, they are made negligent in
their spiritual watch, and so are diverted from the spiritual combate,
and thereby the power and practice of Godliness is diverted
and obstructed. Therefore we are to give heed unto the counsel
of the Holy Ghost; to resist the Devil in his spiritual assaults with
the spiritual weapons that God bestows upon us, and not to give
heed to old Wives Fables, or the false Doctrine of Witchmongers,
that make us watch for the Devil where he is not, and in the mean
time not to resist him where he is, and that is within effectively in
a spiritual manner, for he worketh in the children of disobedience,
and therefore a Devil within us is more to be feared, than a Devil
without us.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Considerat. about Witchcraft, pag. 95, 96.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. These Tenents do uphold that horrid, lying, and blasphemous
opinion, that our blessed Saviour did cast out Devils by <em>Beelzebub</em>
the Prince of Devils: For when they could not deny, nor disprove
the plain and open matters of fact, that our Saviour did really cast
out Devils, then they devilishly invented and vented, that though
he did so, yet it was but by the help of the Prince of Devils, with
whom he had a compact, and so wrought by the greater power to
over-power the less. Concerning which Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> is pleased to
tell us this: “In his return to which he denies not the supposition
or possibility of the thing in general, but clears himself by an appeal
to the actions of their own children, whom they would not
tax so severely.” But by Mr. <em>Glanvils</em> leave we must affirm, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>though it be a bold assertion, yet it is not true; for our Saviour
doth absolutely confute the supposition both in the general, and
also in reference to himself, by shewing the absurdities of it, and
that by these Arguments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Dr. Hammond in Math.</em> 12. 25, <em>&#38;c.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. loc. citat.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. They supposed that the Devils had a Prince or a Ruler that
was able to cast out Devils that were his Subjects, and inferior unto
him, to which his answer is: <em>Every Kingdom divided against it
self is brought to desolation, and every City or house divided against
it self cannot stand. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided
against himself, how shall then his Kingdom stand?</em> Upon which a
most learned Author doth thus paraphrase: “If any King mean to
uphold his Kingdom, he will not quarrel and fall out with his
own Subjects, and cast them out, which are doing him service;
such divisions and civil dissentions as these will soon destroy his
Kingdom, and therefore cannot probably be affirmed of any prudent
Ruler or Prince. And Satans casting out Devils which are
about his business (possessing those he would have possest)
would be such a civil dissention as this, and a breach.” From
whence he necessarily concludeth, that either Satan doth not cast
out Satan, or else that his Kingdom is divided, and cannot stand,
but come to desolation. But Satans Kingdom is not destroyed
nor brought to desolation; therefore it is not divided against it
self, and consequently Satan doth not cast out Satan. Of this
passage <em>Theophylact</em> saith: <i><span lang="la">Quomodo enim Dæmones seipsos ejiciunt,
quum magis inter se conveniant? Satan autem dicitur adversarius.</span></i>
And to the same purpose is that of S. <em>Chrysostom</em>: <i><span lang="la">Si
divisus est, imbecillior factus est, &#38; perit: si autem perit, qualiter
potest alium projicere?</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Hieron. in loc.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Our Saviour saith further: <em>And if I by Beelzebub cast out
devils, by whom do your children cast them out?</em> For as the fore-cited
Author saith: “Why may not I cast out Devils by the Power
and in the Name of God, as well as your Disciples and Country-men,
the Jews among you (who being evil are therefore
more obnoxious to suspicion of holding correspondence with Satans
Kingdom) do, at least pretend to do. When they in the
Name of God go about to cast them out, you affirm it to be the
Power of God, and so do I. Why should you not believe that
of me, which you affirm of your own?” <i><span lang="la">Si expulsio</span></i> (saith S. <em>Hierom</em>)
<i><span lang="la">Dæemonum in filiis vestris Deo, non Dæmonibus deputatur,
quare in me idem opus non eandem habeat &#38; causam?</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>3. Christ further urgeth: <em>But if I cast out Devils by the Spirit of
God, then the Kingdom of God is come upon you or unto you</em>. “But
if it be indeed by the Power of God, that I do all this, then it is
clear, that although you were not aware of it, yet this is the time
of the Messias, whose Mission God hath testified with these Miracles,
and would not have done so, if it had been a false Christ.” So
that he seemeth to conclude thus: “You Scribes and Pharisees seem
to acknowledge, that there are real possessions by Devils, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that they may be thrown out, either by the Power of God or the
power of Satan. But I have shewed the absurdity, that Satan
doth not cast out the Devils his obedient Subjects that are doing
his service; and therefore that what I do must be by the finger
of God, and that must certainly denote unto you, that his
Kingdom is come, and that I am the Messias.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Chrysost. in loc.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. He proceedeth: <em>Or else how can one enter into a strong mans
house, and spoil his goods? except he first bind the strong man, and
then he will spoil his house.</em> “My dispossessing Satan of his goods,
and turning him out of those whom he possesses, is an argument
that I have mastered him, and so that I do not use his power, but
that mine is greater than his, and imployed most against his will,
and to his damage.” <i><span lang="la">Quòd enim</span></i> (as saith a learned Father) <i><span lang="la">non
potest Satanas Satanam ejicere, manifestum ex dictis est: sed quoniam
neq; alius potest eum ejicere, nisi priùs eum superaverit, omnibus
est manifestum: Constituitur ergo quod &#38; anteà, cum manifestiori
abundantia. Dicit enim: Tantum absisto ab hoc quòd utar
Diabolo Coadjutore, quòd prælior cum eo, &#38; ligo eum: Et hujus
conjectura est, quòd vasa ejus diripio. Et sic contrarium ejus quod
illi tentabant dicere, demonstrat. Illi enim volebant ostendere,
quòd non propriâ virtute ejecit Dæmones. Ipse autem ostendit, quòd
non solùm Dæmones, sed &#38; eorum Principem ligavit: quod manifestum
est ab his quæ facta sunt. Qualiter enim Principe non victo,
hi qui subjacent Dæmones direpti sunt?</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>5. Lastly he concludeth: <em>He that is not with me, is against me:
And he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad</em>. “And it’s
proverbially known” (saith Dr. <em>Hammond</em>) “that he that is not on
ones side, that brings Forces into the field, and is not for a mans
assistance, he is certainly for his Enemy, engages against him, doth
him hurt; and consequently my casting out Devils, shews that I
am Satans declared Enemy.” By all which arguments he flatly
overthrows the false supposition of the Pharisees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Absurd. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. These Tenents do overthrow the chief Articles of the Christian
Faith, to wit, the rational and infallible evidence of the Resurrection
of Christ in the same individual and numerical body in
which he suffered: and this we shall elucidate in these particular
Considerations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 15. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. The whole strength of the Christian Religion consists in the
certainty of Christs Resurrection in his true and individual body.
For as the Apostle argueth: <em>And if Christ be not risen, then is our
preaching vain, and your faith is also vain: yea and we are found
false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God, that he raised
up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ risen. And if Christ be
not risen, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your sins. Then also they
which are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished. If in this life only
we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</em> So that
all these sad consequences must needs follow, and the whole Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Religion be found a lye, if Christ be not truly risen from the
dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. And though the Apostle do enumerate sufficient Witnesses
of his Resurrection and appearance after death, <em>and that he was
seen of Cephas, then of the Twelve, after that he was seen of above
five hundred Brethren at once, then of James, then of all the Apostles,
and lastly of himself</em>: Yet all this Cloud of Witnesses will
prove little, but dissolve into vapour, if there were or are either
Angels or Spirits, that in their own or assumed bodies, may appear
in his form, shape, and likeness, and to sight and tangibility be in
all properties as his body was, to have flesh and bones, the print
of the nails in the hands and feet, and to eat and drink.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Rolloc. in Joh. 20.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. That the Apostles held the opinion, that there was Apparitions
and Spirits that did shew themselves in any form or likeness,
is most plain and evident; for when they saw Christ walking upon
the Sea, they supposed it had been a Spirit or Apparition, for
the Greek is <span lang="grc">φάντασμα</span>, and cryed out. That is, either being cruelly
affrighted and amazed, their Phantasies did represent strange
thoughts in their minds: or else (which doubtless was the truth)
seeing Christ walking upon the Sea, which they thought was not
possible for a man to do without sinking or drowning, they in
great fear cryed out, and forgetting his former Miracles, did vainly
suppose it some Spirit that had made an apparition in his likeness.
But it is most strange, that the Disciples that had seen and been eye-witnesses
of so many Miracles wrought by him during his life, and
those that accompanied him at his death, as the renting of the veil
of the Temple from the top to the bottom, and the Earth-quake,
and the renting of the Rocks, and the Darkness that was over the
Land from the sixth hour unto the ninth; and that after his Resurrection
the Graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints that
slept arose, and came out of the Graves, and went into the holy
City, and appeared unto many, of which they could not be ignorant;
It is (I say) most wondrous strange, that after all these they could
doubt of the verity of his Resurrection, and imagine that it was a
Spirit in his form and likeness. And most especially, considering
that his Sepulchre was made sure, the stone sealed, and a Watch set
to attend it, of which they could not be ignorant; and likewise
the certain affirmation and evidence of the two <em>Maries</em>, from the
mouth of the Angel, and their own sight who worshipped him,
and held him by the feet, and <em>Peters</em> finding the Sepulchre empty,
and his appearing to the two Disciples that went to <em>Emmaus</em>, and
yet for all this at his next appearance, not to be satisfied, but to be
terrified and affrighted, and to suppose they had seen a Spirit, is
beyond all wonder, but that doubtless the heavenly Father had so
ordained it in his inscrutable Wisdom, that the infallible certainty
of his Resurrection might be more evidently and punctually proved.
For at his next appearing, when they were all together, Jesus
himself stood in the midst of them, and said unto them, <em>Peace</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>be unto you. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed
they had seen a Spirit, there the word is <span lang="grc">πνεῦμα</span>. Now the cause
of this supposing that they had seen a Spirit, doubtless was because
as St. John tells us, <em>That Jesus twice had stood in the midst of
them, the doors being shut, because of the Jews</em>, and therefore they
could not possibly imagine, that he could have a body that could
make penetration of dimensions, not considering that he had an
omnipotent Power, and therefore nothing could be impossible unto
him. Though it may well be conceived to be done without
penetration of dimensions, because by his Almighty Power he might
imperceptibly both open and shut the doors, and so enter, and suddenly
stand in the midst of them, and no humane sense be able to
discern it. But however it was, the Disciples did not then believe
that it was Christ with his individual body in which he suffered,
but either (as some of the Fathers believed) that it was his very
Spirit that he yielded up upon the Cross, that appeared in his figure
or shape, that was so pure, fine, and penetrable, that it could
pass through any Medium, though never so dense or solid: or some
other Spirit that assumed his form and shape, which is far more probable
and sound. But howsoever it was, they did believe that it
was some Spirit in his likeness, and not he himself, in that very numerical
body in which he suffered, as may be apparently gathered
from the words of <em>Thomas</em> called <em>Didymus</em>, who strongly affirmed,
saying: <em>Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put
my fingers into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his
side, I will not believe</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Rolloc. ubi supr.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Caten. Aur. Tho. Aquin. in locum.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. To the grounds of all these doubts our Saviour gives a demonstrative
and infallible solution, which we shall explain in these
particulars. 1. He doth not at all deny the existence or beings
of Spirits; neither that Spirits do not, or cannot make visible apparitions:
but doth grant both. 2. But he restrains these apparitions
to those inseparable properties that belong to Bodies and Spirits,
that is, a body (that is to say an humane body) hath flesh and bones,
but a Spirit hath neither, as Christs or humane bodies have; and
therefore saith a learned Person upon the place: <i><span lang="la">Docet se non esse
Spiritum hoc modo: Spiritus, inquit, non habet carnem &#38; ossa.
Ego verò, ut conspicitis, habeo carnem &#38; ossa: Ergo ego non sum Spiritus.
Vide igitur ex sensu &#38; sensibilibus: sensu nimirum visus;
sensu tactus: ex visibilibus &#38; tractabilibus se corpus esse non autem
Spiritum edocet. Per sensum enim fides &#38; gignitur &#38; confirmatur.</span></i>
So that whether Spirits be taken to be corporeal (and so appear
in their own bodies) or to be incorporeal (and so to appear in
assumed bodies) yet are they both to sight, and especially to feeling,
not as humane bodies are that have flesh and bones. So that
however they do, may or can appear (for it must be considered in
that latitude, else our Saviours argument would not be irrefragable
and convincing) they to the resistibility of touching cannot be as
flesh and bones are, for they to the sense of touching do resist, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>are solid, but so the bodies of Spirits in what appearance soever
have not, nor can have, otherwise our Saviours argument falls to
the ground, and proves nothing. 3. He confirmeth this by the
Disciples own proof of feeling and touching the prints or scars of
the nails in his hands, and the print of the wound in his side, and
thereby manifesteth that it was he himself, and the very same individual
body in which he suffered, by which <em>Thomas</em> his great unbelief
and doubting was unanswerably satisfied, by putting his fingers
into or upon the very prints of the nails, and by putting his hand
into or upon the wound or scar upon his side. And therefore though
the same power that raised him from the dead, and rouled the
sealed stone from the Sepulchre, could have perfected his body to
be without prints or scars of the wounds; yet did the divine Wisdom
reserve them, thereby to cure the infidelity of his Disciples,
and undeniably to confirm the truth of his Resurrection; to which
purpose one said well: <i><span lang="la">Ibi ad dubitantium corda sananda, vulnerum
sunt servata vestigia</span></i>. And the further to establish and settle
their Faith, he took a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb,
and eat before them; all which concluded him to have a
true body, and that he was not a Spirit: from whence we draw
these conclusions.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. That howsoever Spirits do or may appear, they have not, or
can have such a body, that in respect of tangibility, is as flesh and
bones. For flesh and bones are dense, solid, and make sensible resistance
to the touch; but the bodies of Spirits in their apparitions
are not, nor can be so. For as we deny not but there are and
may be apparitions in any figure or shape, yet they can but be as
the figures and shapes in the Clouds, which are often seen, and
cause much wonder, though (we suppose) many of them may be
rather attributed to the assimilation made in mens fancies, than to
their real existence in those forms or shapes. So they may be as
shadows, or the species of bodies that we see near or afar off, or as
the images that we behold of our selves and other things in Mirrours
or Looking-glasses: which though without doubt they be
not non-entities, for <i><span lang="la">nullius entis nulla est operatio</span></i>, but these affect
the senses, which is an operation or action; yet do they all easily
yield to the touch, and have no firmness nor solidity, as flesh and
bones have; and this is all that can be justly deduced from our
Saviours argumentation.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Either we must believe that our Saviours argument is of no
force and validity, which is blasphemous and horrid to affirm or imagine,
he being the way, the truth, and the life, and in whose mouth
there was found no guile, and thereby overthrow the whole foundation
of the Christian Religion: or else we must for certain believe
that Spirits whensoever they appear have no such solidity or resistibility
as to touch, as flesh and bones have. And consequently that
what strange things soever we may by sight and touch take to be the
apparitions of Spirits, that to touch have the solidity of flesh and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>bones, we must conclude that they are not Spirits, but must be
some other kind of Creatures, of whose nature and properties we
are to inquire; for doubtless (as we shall manifest hereafter)
there are many strange Creatures, that for their rarity or strange
qualities, have been and are mistaken for the apparition of Spirits.
For the Disciples doubts must still have remained unsatisfied, if
Spirits could appear to have bodies to touch, of that solidity that
flesh and bones are of, and then the truth of our Saviours Resurrection
falls to the ground, and the Christian Faith is vain.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Therefore that Demons do appear in the shape of Dogs, Cats,
and the like, and do carry the heavy bodies of Witches in the air,
do suck upon their bodies, and have carnal copulation with them,
must suppose them to have bodies as solid and tangible as flesh and
bones: and so overthrow the main proof of our Saviours Resurrection,
and consequently the very foundation of the Christian Religion;
<em>For if Christ be not risen our faith is vain, we are yet in our
sins, and are of all men most miserable</em>, as having only hope in this
life, and no further. And this is sufficient to shew the horrid and
execrable absurdity of these opinions; which objection Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>
calls spiteful and mischievous, but durst not undertake the solution,
but with a plain shuffle leaves and over-runs it, as indeed
being too hard a morsel for his tender teeth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 18. 1, 4, 8.</div>

<p class='c008'>And if any do object (as we have heard some do) that three Angels
did appear unto <em>Abraham</em> in the Plains of <em>Mamre</em>, as he sate
in the Tent-door, and did eat and drink, and washed their feet,
and therefore that they had flesh and bones; to that we return
this responsion.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It is a very froward and perverse way of arguing, to make
one place of Scripture to clash with another, when they ought all
to be expounded according to the Analogy of faith, and it is a
perfect Harmony which we ought to labour to find out and rejoyce
in.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Heb. 1. 1, 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. It is no perfect way of arguing from the Dispensations in the
time of the Patriarchs and Prophets, to those that God useth now
in the time of the Gospel; for so they might argue that God should
answer by <em>Urim</em> and <em>Thummim</em>, because he did so in the time of the
Levitical Priesthood, but that is now ceased, and the Apostle tells
us: <em>God at sundry times, and in divers manners spake in times past
unto the Fathers by the Prophets: But in these last days he hath
spoken by his Son unto us</em>. So though God did then vouchsafe to
make himself manifest unto the Patriarchs by the visible appearance
of Angels: yet it is no rational consequence that he doth so
now in these days.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>v.</em> 17.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. It is manifest, that though they were in number three, yet it
is true that it was Jehovah that appeared unto <em>Abraham</em>, and Jehovah
said, <em>Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do</em>. Now
we do not find that the word Jehovah is communicable to any
Creature, but only to God himself; and therefore the best Expositors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>do understand (notwithstanding what <em>Pererius</em> doth say to
the contrary) that one of them was Christ the second Person in the
Trinity, who after was to take humane nature upon him, and
therefore did so appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. However these Angels had with them the assistance of a divine
and omnipotent Power, which cannot rationally be affirmed
of the common and ordinary apparitions of Demons to Witches,
and therefore doth conclude nothing against what we have laid
down before.</p>

alledged to prove these things, they have been wrested
and drawn to uphold these Tenents by those Translators that had
imbibed these Opinions, and so instead of following the true and
genuine signification of the words, they haled them to make good
a preconceived Opinion, and did not simply and plainly render
them as they ought to have been. Which hath been observed by
divers, especially by <em>Wierus</em>, who got the learned <em>Masius</em> (a great
Hebrician) to interpret them, of which he hath given a full account,
which was followed by Mr. <em>Scot</em>. As also Mr. <em>Ady</em>, who
hath perfectly rendred them according to the Translation of <em>Junius</em>
and <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>, and likewise Mr. <em>Wagstaff</em> hath prettily opened the
most of them. So that our attempt here might seem to be superfluous
and unnecessary, and may be condemned of arrogance and
vain confidence. To which we reply, That it is far from us to
compare our selves with those Learned men that were Masters of
the Hebrew and Greek Tongues, being in comparison but a Smatterer
in those Languages, yet have in our younger years both studied
and taught them to others, and as far as we undertake, we
hope we need not fear the censure of the most rigid Critick; intending
to note some things that others have omitted, and to handle
them to the full, which others have but done briefly. And this
we shall prosecute in this order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deut. 18. 10.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. We shall take the words in the same order as they are recited
in <em>Deuteronomy</em>, and the first mentioned is in these words: <em>There
shall not be found among you that maketh his son or his daughter to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>pass through the fire</em>. Now here we shall not enter upon that great
Dispute, whether they really burned and sacrificed by burning their
children unto Moloch, or that they only dedicated them to that
Idol, by making them pass through the fire; but examine the reasons,
why those that practised this kind of Idolatry are ranked amongst
the Diviners or Witches, and were to have the same punishment,
seeing it is no where mentioned, that these used any kind of
Divination at all, and these we conceive to be the chief.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Vers. 14, 15.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. The Lord had promised his People to raise them up a Prophet
from amongst their Brethren like unto <em>Moses</em>, and that therefore
they should hear him, and not go after other Gods or Idols.
And therefore he sent them many and divers Prophets, of whom
they were to inquire: so likewise they gave the Priest order to inquire
by <em>Urim</em> and <em>Thummim</em>, by which he gave answers, and therefore
they were to hearken to his Ordinances, and not to follow after
other strange Gods: For the Nations that he cast out had hearkened
unto Observers of times and Diviners, but they were not to do
so. And though these that caused their children to pass through
the fire unto <em>Moloch</em>, used not Divinations, yet it was a wicked and
abominable Ceremony, and the use and end of it to lead the people
to Idolatry, and therefore is reckoned amongst the rest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Prov. 16. 10.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isa. 3. 2.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Exod. 22. 20.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. They are solely condemned, because the end of all their Divinations
and their other Feats, were only to draw and lead the
people to Idolatry, and to serve other Gods. For it is manifest,
that all ways and sorts of Divination were not in themselves evil
and unlawful, for else Astronomy it self, that foretels the Entrance
of the Sun and Moon into such Signs, and when Eclipses will happen,
and the like, should be forbidden too, but they were not: so
that the chief reason why they were condemned, was <i><span lang="la">sub ratione
finis, non medii</span></i>, in regard of the end, and not of the means used,
because all their Divinations, and other Arts, Crafts, or Feats,
whether performed by natural or artificial means, or otherwise,
had still for their chief and principal end the leading of the people
unto Idolatry, and the serving of other Gods, which was above all
things abominable and hateful unto God, who is a jealous God,
and will not give his glory to graven Images. And therefore all
Idol-Priests, or those that lead the people to Idolatry, are in the
Scripture-sense Witches, Diviners, and the like. And that all Divinations
were not forbidden, is most clear from that of <em>Solomon</em>,
as <em>Arias Montanus</em> translates it: <i><span lang="la">Divinatio super labiis regis</span></i>: and
that of <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i>, where the Lord threateneth to take away the staff
and stay of <em>Jerusalem</em>, that is, the mighty man, and the man of war,
the Judge, the Prophet, and the prudent, <i><span lang="la">Divinum, sive Sagacem</span></i>.
For it is the same word, and from the same root <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>קָסַם</span> <em>Divinavit</em>:
For as <em>Avenarius</em>, <em>Schindler</em>, and others say, <i><span lang="la">Est verbum medium,
nam modò in bonam, modò in malam partem accipitur</span></i>, of which <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>
saith this: <i><span lang="la">Sagacitas, id est, consultissima prudentia in rebus
dijudicandis, præcavendis, &#38; veluti addivinandis: nam vox
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Hebræa media est sive anceps, quæ non tantùm in malam partem accipitur,
sed etiam in bonam</span></i>. Therefore was the Law so strict, that
if any sacrificed unto any other God, save unto the Lord only, he
was utterly to be destroyed, much more those that lead and incited
the people to serve and sacrifice unto other strange Gods, were
to be rooted out.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Is the word we have named before, to wit, <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>קֹסֵם קְסָמִים</span>,<a id='t108'></a> <em>Kosem
Kesamim, Divinans divinationes</em>: which, as we have shewed
before, was taken <i><span lang="la">in bonam &#38; malam partem</span></i>, and is by the Septuagint
fitly rendred <span lang="grc">μαντευόμενος μαντειαν</span> <i><span lang="la">vaticinans vaticinium</span></i>, and
is almost with all Translators rendred in that sense and propriety:
so that we need not complain, that it is one of them that is mis-translated;
but concerning it, we may note these things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Sam. 6. 1, 2. 3, 7, 8, 9.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Hos. 4. 12. Ezek. 21. 21.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. That there were and are almost innumerable ways, whereby
men have undertaken to Divine and foretel things to come, some of
which were by lawful means and ways, as all prudent, sagacious,
and experienced men have done, and may do. Some by vain, trivial,
foolish, and groundless ways, as by the flying of birds, their
noise and motion, and so of beasts, by casting lots, dice, and the
like, which have no causality or efficiency in them at all to declare
things to come, but were meerly vain and superstitious, with which
the Heathen World doth still abound, and they are not yet totally
eradicated from amongst Christians. The most foolish of which
was this, That when the Philistins had kept the Ark of the Lord
seven months, they called the Priests and the Diviners, to know
what to do with it, and they advised them not to send it away
empty, but to send five golden Emerods and five golden Mice, and
to take a new Cart and two Milch-kine, upon which there had
com’d no yoke, and to tye them to the Cart, and to bring their
Calves home from them, and to lay the Ark in the Cart, and the
Jewels of Gold to be put in a Coffer by, thinking that if they
went up towards <em>Beth-shemesh</em> that was the Israelites Coast, that
if they did so, then it was he that smote them, otherwise that
it was but a chance that happened unto them. And this in respect
of the Priests and Diviners was only a casual conjecture at Random,
though God in his Providence did order it according to his
Divine Wisdom for the best. Like unto this was that mentioned
by the Prophet, a <em>Consulter with his staff</em>, as also that of <em>Ezekiel</em>:
<em>For the King of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head
of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he
consulted with images, (Teraphim) he looked in the liver</em>. And
besides these there were others that pretended Visions and Revelations
from their Gods or Idols; but how far either Idols, or Devils,
or their Priests could truly foretel things to come, is very
doubtful and hard to determine, of which we shall have occasion
to speak hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. We are to note, that though there were never so many ways
of Divination used, and whether the means used to predict by,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>were natural or supernatural, lawful or unlawful, frivolous and superstitious,
or taken upon sound and rational grounds, yet were
they all wicked and abominable, because they were used to withdraw
the people from those Ordinances that God had appointed
to give answers by, and to lead the people to inquire of vain and
lying Idols, and their Priests, and thereby to commit Idolatry; and
so whatsoever the means were, the end was wicked and damnable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isa. 41. 23.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Jer. 10. 5.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. Moreover, what answers soever the Priests forged and gave
(for it is manifest, that the Idols gave none at all; <em>for they had
mouths and spake not, ears and heard not, eyes and saw not, feet
and walked not, neither was there breath in their nostrils</em>) were nothing
but lyes and conjectures of their own devising, and there an
Idol in the Hebrew is sometimes styled <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>אֱלִיל</span> <i><span lang="la">nihilum</span></i>, and therefore
saith the Prophet: <em>The Prophets prophesie lyes in my Name, I sent
them not, neither have I commanded them. They prophesie unto you
a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit
of their heart.</em> Unto which the Apostle alludeth, when he saith:
<em>We know that an Idol is nothing in the world, and that there is
none other God but one.</em> That is, that an Idol taken abstractively,
without regard to the matter of which it was made, as gold, silver,
stone, wood, or the like, which were natural substances, or respect
to the figure or shape which was artificial, and the work of the
Work-man, it was plainly nothing, and had no real existence as a
God or Idol, but only in the Phantasies and minds of the blinded
Worshippers; for it neither could truly foretel, nor act any thing
of it self, but all that was done, was the lyes and inventions of the
Priests that served them, and got their living by that villanous and
lying trade. For God by the mouth of his Prophet doth set down
the true difference of the true God, that could infallibly foretel and
declare things that were to come, from the false Gods and Idols,
and doth challenge them in this manner: <em>Shew the things that are
to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods: yea do good
or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together</em>. From
whence it is plain, that the only <span lang="grc">κριτήριον</span> to distinguish betwixt the
Divinations that are given forth by the Spirit of God in his Prophets
or Apostles is, that they are plain, certain, and infallible, and
the event never faileth to answer the Prediction, but those that are
given forth by Satan and his juggling and lying Ministers, are
always ambiguous, doubtful, and perplex, and evermore deceive
such as trust in them, as was manifest in Ahab, when all the false
Prophets bade him go up to <em>Ramoth Gilead</em>, and prosper, yet there
was he slain. And as they never truly foretel things to come, so
neither can the Idols do good or evil: all that is, or ever was done,
was performed only by the cunning, confederacy, and juggling of
the knavish and deceitful Priests; and therefore the Prophet admonisheth
Gods people not to be afraid of them; <em>For they cannot
do evil, neither also is it in them to do good</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deut. 13. 1, 2, 3.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>4. We are to note, that if a Sign or Wonder foretold do come
to pass, we have no Warrant to ascribe the bringing of it to pass
either to Devil or Witch, for the Lord telleth us this: <em>If there
arise among you a Prophet or a Dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee
a sign or a wonder. And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof
he spoke unto thee, saying; Let us go after other Gods (which thou
hast not known) and let us serve them: Thou shalt not hearken to
the words of that Prophet or that Dreamer of dreams: For the Lord
your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your God
with all your heart, and with all your soul.</em> So that what Divinations
or Predictions soever be foretold by any, or what signs or
wonders soever be brought to pass, if the persons that work or foretel
them, perswade us to serve other Gods, or go to seduce us to Idolatry,
we are not to follow them, but are to know that by them
the Lord doth prove us, to try if we love him with all our heart, or
not. And if there were no other means to distinguish a true Miracle
from a false, yet were this infallibly sufficient to instruct and direct
us.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. We may note, that of all the several sorts of Divinations pretended,
and of all the acceptations of this Hebrew word in all the
Bible, there is nothing that doth imply any such kind of killing
Witch, as is commonly imagined, nor none such as make a visible
League with the Devil, nor upon whose bodies he sucketh, or hath
carnal copulation with them, nor no such as are really changed into
Cats, Hares, Wolves, or Dogs; which was the thing we undertook
to prove.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The next word we are to consider, is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>עֹנֵן</span>,<a id='t110'></a> which <em>Avenarius</em>,
<em>Schindlerus</em>, <em>Buxtorsius</em>, and Mr. <em>Goodwin</em> do derive from <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>עֹנֵן</span> <i><span lang="la">obnubilavit,
nubem obduxit, item præstigiis usus est</span></i>. From whence we
may note these things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Polyglot. in loc.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. That the most of all the Translators do some render it by one
word, and some by another, that no certainty can be gathered from
them at all, as though it did signifie divers and many sorts of these
kinds of Augury, Divinations, or juggling Feats, when in reason
we cannot but suppose that it only comprehended some one sort,
and not so many as the Translators do ascribe to it. The Septuagint
render it for the most part <span lang="grc">κληδονιζόμενος</span>, sometimes <span lang="grc">αποφθεγγόμενος</span>,
and sometimes <span lang="grc">ὀρνιθοσκοπήσεθε</span>, which are all of different derivations
and significations; some others render it other ways, as, <i><span lang="la">neq; auspicabimini,
neq; observabitis horas, ne vaticinemini, ne ominemini, nec
observet somnia &#38; auguria, nec qui exercet Astrologiam, &#38;c.</span></i> Now
from such a diversity no man is able to draw a positive certainty.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. They do not keep to one word appropriate to the Hebrew,
which if they had not forgotten themselves, they would have
done, and not left it uncertain. For <em>Arias Montanus</em> in the 19. of
<em>Leviticus</em>, <em>vers.</em> 26. renders it, <i><span lang="la">neq; præstigiabamini</span></i>, and in the 2. of
<i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i>, <em>vers.</em> 6. translates it, <i><span lang="la">augures sicut Philistim</span></i>. In <em>Isa.</em> 57. 3.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>he calleth them <i><span lang="la">Filii Auguratricis</span></i>. And in the 27. of <em>Jeremiah</em>, <em>v.</em> 9.
<i><span lang="la">Et ad Augures vestros.</span></i> Also <em>Micah</em> 5. 11. he renders it <em>Præstigiatores</em>.
Now what great difference there is betwixt any sort of
Augury, and Juggling, or Leger-de-main, is known to any of indifferent
reading. And the rest of the Translators are far more
wild, and more wide. And <em>Junius</em> and <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>, who of all others,
one might have thought would have been more circumspect,
yet fall into the same incertitude; for in Deut. 18. 10. he renders
it <em>Planetarius</em>, but in the place before-cited in <em>Leviticus</em>, they render
it, <i><span lang="la">neq; utemini præstigiis</span></i>, though in the Margent they mend
it, with this note, <i><span lang="la">neq; ex nubibus conjicite, vel ne temporis observationi
plus æquo tribuite</span></i>. And <em>Isa.</em> 2. 6. <i><span lang="la">Et præstigiatores sunt
ut Polischtæi.</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid.</em> <em>Jo. Wier. de mag. Jus.</em> <em>c.</em> 1. <em>p.</em> 91.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Of Divin. <em>lib.</em> 4. <em>cap.</em> 10. <em>p.</em> 183.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. But if there be any certainty in adhering to the primitive
signification of the Hebrew root, that plainly intendeth <i><span lang="la">obnubilavit</span></i>,
that it is without question most safe and genuine to translate
it Planetarius, to which the most learned <em>Andreas Masius</em> (as he is
quoted by <em>Wierus</em>) doth incline in these words: <i><span lang="la">Veteres Hebræorum
dicunt id verbum ad eos propriè pertinere, qui temporum momenta
superstitiosè observant, atq; alia fausta rebus gerendis, alia
infausta præscribunt</span></i>. To which agreeth Mr. <em>Thomas Goodwin</em>,
saying: “But of all I approve those who derive it from <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>עִנֵּן</span> a
Cloud, as if the Original signified properly a Planetary, or Stargazer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>4. But however thus far there is no word found, that signifieth
a Witch in the sense we have laid down, nor any such person that
hath a real familiar Spirit, either in them, or attending upon
them, ready visibly to appear at their beck, this is not yet to be
found out.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The next is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>וּמְנַחֵשׁ</span><a id='t111'></a> from the root <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>נִחֵשׁ</span>, <i><span lang="la">nichesch, auguratus est,
observavit, augurium fecit</span></i>, which our English Translators have
erroneously rendred an Inchanter, which it no way signifieth, nor
hath any relation unto, having in the next verse named a Charmer,
as though Enchanter and Charmer were not all one, when the
word plainly (as Mr. <em>Goodwin</em> and the learned <em>Masius</em> do confess)
importeth an Augur or Sooth-sayer: That is, such an one, who out
of his own experience draweth observations of good or evil to
come: of which we may note these things.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The most of all the Translations given us in the <em>Polyglot</em>, do
render the Hebrew word by <i><span lang="la">auguratus est</span></i>, and so understand it to
be an Augur or Sooth-sayer, a Conjecturer, or an Observer, from
whatsoever it be that he taketh his observations, as from the flying
noise or motion of birds or beasts, looking into their entrails, and
the like, and from thence taking upon them to foretel good or
evil to come, or what was hidden and secret.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The Hebrew word, is by the Septuagint rendred <span lang="grc">οἰώνισμα</span>,
<i><span lang="la">Augurium, Auspicium</span></i>, that is, an Augur, an Observer, or a Conjecturer,
which <em>Luther</em> translateth: <span class='blackletter'>eyn de vp Voegell geschrey achte</span>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>And in the Low Dutch Bible it is rendred agreeable thereto; and
the French render it <i><span lang="fr">aux Oiseaux</span></i>, from the word <i><span lang="fr">Oiseau</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">Avis, Volucris</span></i>;
and the Italians render it <em>Auguropista</em>, which are all to one
purpose, and no difference at all, and so the gross mistake of our
English Translators is most apparent, that make it to be an Inchanter
or Charmer, to which it hath no relation at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 30. 27.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 44. 5, 15.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. This Hebrew word is taken <i><span lang="la">in bonam partem</span></i>, heedfully to
consider, mark, or observe, as <em>Laban</em> said, when he laboured to
stay <em>Jacob</em> from going from him: <em>I have learned by experience that
the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake</em>. So that though <em>Laban</em>’s heart
was not upright toward <em>Jacob</em>, nor he a sincere Worshipper of the
God of the Jews; yet so far had the Lord convinced him, by the
faithful and industrious service of <em>Jacob</em> that he had experienced,
and by tryal found that the Lord had blessed him for <em>Jacob</em>’s sake.
And the same word is used, when <em>Joseph</em> said: <em>Is not this the cup
wherein my Lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth, or maketh
tryal?</em> And again: <em>Know ye not, that such a man as I can certainly
divine, or make tryal?</em> And though <em>Pererius</em> hath made a
large Dispute about this matter, and reciteth the Opinions of many
Authors concerning it; yet it is manifest, that <em>Joseph</em> knew his
Brethren before, and had caused the Cup to be put into <em>Benjamins</em>
Sack, and that all this was but done in a just and prudent way, the
better to prepare his Brethren for his revealing of himself unto
them, and so had reference to no unlawful conjecturing at all,
though it was plain, that he had the special gift from God of interpreting
of Dreams, and foretelling of things that were to
come.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. It is too hard a task to enumerate all the several ways that
the Heathens used, by observation to foretel things to come, and
more difficult so declare all the subjects from whence they gathered
the signs of their Predictions. The chiefest that the old <em>Romans</em>
used, were <i><span lang="la">Augurium quasi Avigerium dictum, vel Avigarium,
ab avium scilicet garritu quem auspicantes observabant</span></i>: And so
<i><span lang="la">Auspicium, quasi Avispecium, ab avibus spectandis</span></i>. And these observations
were taken, either from the feeding, flying, or noise of
the birds. So they had their <em>Haruspices</em>, <em>Harioli</em>, and <em>Haruspicina</em>,
which was derived <i><span lang="la">ab haruga, hostia, ab hara in qua concluditur &#38;
servatur</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 16. 2, 3.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 12. 54.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. But all these sorts of Observations, Guessings, and Conjectures may be
considered these three ways. 1. Some of them are
natural, rational, and legal; as is the Prognostick part of the Art
of Medicine, Political Predictions of the change, fall, and ruine of
Kingdoms, States, and Empires. Some Civil taken from the course
and carriage of men, as when one seeth a rich young Heir that followeth
nothing but vice, luxury, and all sorts of debauchery, it is
easie to foretel that his end will be beggery and misery. Some
from the due observation of beasts and fowls, which live <i><span lang="la">sub dio</span></i>,
may easily conjecture the alteration of the weather. And so by observing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the change, or colour of the Stars and Planets, the Clouds and
Elements, may easily foretel the change of weather. And we find
that these predictions from the Signs gathered from natural causes,
are not condemned by our Blessed Saviour, who saith: <em>When it is
evening, ye say it will be fair weather, for the skie is red. And in
the morning, it will be foul weather to day, for the skie is red, and
lowring.</em> And again: <em>When ye see a cloud rise out of the West, straightway
ye say, there cometh a showre, and so it is. And when ye see
the South wind blow, ye say, there will be heat, and it cometh to
pass.</em> 2. There are some conjectures that are false, groundless, and
superstitious, as were, and are all the predictions taken from the
feeding, flying or noise of Fowls, or the signs appearing in the intrails
of Beasts; for in all such like, there is no connexion betwixt
the cause and effect, and they therefore are false and vain, and this was
one of the reasons why they were forbidden amongst the Jews.
3. There were some that in regard of their use and end were wicked
and Idolatrous, and in this respect all divinations and predictions
are wicked and unlawful, if they be used (as was and is yet among
the Heathen) to lead the people unto, or confirm them in,
the worship of Idols, and false Gods. And from all this it appeareth,
that yet we can find no proper or fit word for such a kind of
Witch whose existence we have denied and are disproving.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The next word in this place of <em>Deuteronomy</em> is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>וּמְכַשֵּׁף</span> <em>Umechascheph</em>,<a id='t113'></a>
which our Translators render a Witch, but in what sense
or propriety, I think few can conjecture, for it comes from the Hebrew
root, <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>כֹּשֵּׁף</span> <em>Coscheph</em>, which <em>Avenarius</em> rendreth, <i><span lang="la">Fascinavit,
effascinavit</span></i>, but <em>Schindlerus</em> translates it, <i><span lang="la">Præstigias, maleficia aut
magiam exercuit, mutavit aliquid naturale ad aspectum oculi, ut aliud
appareat quàm est</span></i>. And by <em>Buxtorsius</em> it is rendred, <em>Præstigiæ</em>,
and the derivations from it through the whole Old Testament,
which is the most certain propriety of the word, as these following
considerations will make manifest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chap. 7. 11, 22.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Chron. 2. 33. 6.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Kings 9. 22.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. That the most of the Translators in rendering this word whether
in this place, or in others, have been very inconstant, and
one place not agreeing with another, as <em>Arias Montanus</em> in this
place gives it <i><span lang="la">maleficus</span></i>, but in <em>Exodus</em> he makes it, <em>Præstigiatores</em>,
and in the 22 and 16 of the same Book he makes it <em>Præstigiatricem</em>;
and in another place where the very same word is used in the Hebrew,
he saith of <i><span lang="la">Manásseh, &#38; Præstigiis vacabat</span></i>. And yet in another
place, he rendereth the very same word <i><span lang="la">veneficia</span></i>. So uncertain
was this learned Man, and so inconsiderate in his versions,
wherein he ought to have had a more special care. Now <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>
in all the places named before, doth use the words <i><span lang="la">Præstigiatorem</span></i>,
and the words from the same derivation in the Latine, which
sheweth certainty and constancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The most of all the translations in the Polyglott, do render
this word doubtful and various: As <i><span lang="la">maleficus</span></i>, <em>magus</em>, <i><span lang="la">præstigias faciens</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la">Incantator</span></i>, and the like, which are all dubious, and various,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and no certainty can be produced from them. Only those we call the
<em>Septuagint</em> do keep close to words of the same signification, deducted
all from <span lang="grc">φάρμακον</span>, which properly doth signifie no more than
<i><span lang="la">venenum</span></i>, poison, though the circumstances do manifest that they
were but Jugling and Imposture. And the High-Dutch, Low-Dutch,
French and Italian translations do all render it with the same
uncertainty, so that nothing sure can be drawn from them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Moses and Aaron <em>l.</em> 4. <em>c.</em> 10. <em>p.</em> 191.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Com. upon Exod. <em>c.</em> 7. <em>p.</em> 72.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. But to leave these uncertainties, it is manifest that this word
doth signifie as <em>Buxtorsius</em><a id='t114'></a> and <em>Schindlerus</em> do render it, for they are
best to be trusted, because they are not guilty of contradiction as
the most of the others are; That is, a Jugler, or one that by himself,
or the help of his Confederates, doth by sleight of hand, and such
like conveyances perform strange things to the astonishment of the
beholders. “And therefore doth Mr. <em>Goodwyn</em> tell us this: A Witch,
properly a Jugler. The original (he saith) signifieth such a kind of Sorcerer,
who bewitcheth the senses and minds of men, by changing the
forms of things, making them appear otherwise than indeed they
are. And these Dr. <em>Willet</em> saith (speaking of <em>Pharaohs</em> Magicians)
were <em>Præstigiatores</em>, whom we call Juglers, which deceived
mens senses. And though learned <em>Masius</em> (speaking of those that
<em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> called to interpret his dream) doth make this objection,
that if this word be translated <em>Præstigiatores</em>, he doth not
see, <i><span lang="la">quid illi ad explicandum somnium adferre suâ arte potuissent,
quæ tota fallax &#38; delusoria est</span></i>:” Yet is this of little or no force at
all, for the rest that were called, were as well Impostors as these if not
more, and the King and those with him knew not certainly (as the event
shewed) that they could perform any such matter, but was ignorant
of the manner of their delusions and cheats, and was only
led by common rumour and belief, grounded upon the vain
and lying boasts that such sort of people are apt to give out of themselves,
and the wonders they pretend to perform. So that from
his and his Courtiers opinions of either the matter, or manner, of
what they pretended to do, will no consequence be drawn, from
what they truly could do, because belief and action are two different
things as might be manifested by the vain credulity of the
vulgar, that those kind of deceivers can do strange things, but in
trial and experiment they are found to be Cheaters and Impostors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chap. 7. 11.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. But that this word doth bear this signification is manifest
from the things they performed, for in <em>Exodus</em> they are called
<span lang='he' dir='rtl'>כַשְּׁפִים</span>, <em>and they in like manner cast down every man his rod and
they became serpents</em>: not that their rods were really transubstantiated
into true serpents as <em>Aarons</em> was, for that could not be done
but by an Omnipotent and Divine power, which they had not;
It was only done as Juglers, do seemingly, by sleight and cunning,
and so had an appearance of true serpents, but were not so indeed;
or else in making a shew to throw down their rods, they secretly
conveyed them away and threw down serpents in their stead, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>might easily be done by sleight of hand, as we shall shew more fully
hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Kings 9. 22.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Chap. 21. 8. 22. 51. 9. 21. 18. 23.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Chap. 5. 20.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. That this is the genuine meaning of this word is manifest from
the circumstances of some other places duly weighed, and compared
together: for one text saith as our English Translators have rendered
it, <em>And it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu that he said,
Is it peace Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the
whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her witchcrafts are so many?</em>
Now why they should translate it witchcrafts, cannot well be imagined,
except it were to draw the Scriptures to speak according
to their preconceived opinions, for the word used there is the same
we speak of, to wit, <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>וּכְשָׁפֶיהָ</span>,<a id='t115'></a> which though <em>Arias Montanus</em> rendereth,
<i><span lang="la">&#38; veneficia ejus</span></i>, that according to the Latine signification
is but poysonings, or poyson making, which doth not intimate
Witchcraft in that sense that is vulgarly understood, which <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>
properly renders, <i><span lang="la">&#38; præstigæ ejus</span></i>: and <em>Luther</em> renders it by the
words <span class='blackletter'>Toeverye</span>, and so doth the Low-Dutch: Though the proper
High-Dutch word for <i><span lang="la">præstigiator</span></i>, a Jugler, be <span class='blackletter'>Baucsler</span>, which
is as <em>Calepin</em> tells us, that <i><span lang="la">Præstigæ sunt incantationes, delusiones,
cujusmodi sunt, quæ manuum quadam dexteritate alia apparent
quam reverâ sunt</span></i>. Now what whoredoms or fornications had <em>Jezebel</em>
committed? Spiritual whoredoms, and not Carnal ones; for
she had her self gone a whoring after Idols, and strange gods,
and as much as in her lay drew the people of <em>Israel</em> into the same
whoredoms, and for this it was that so fearful a judgment fell upon
her. And what Witchcrafts (if they must be so called) had she practised
or followed? Was it any other than in setting up, maintaining,
and defending the Priests of <em>Baal</em> and of the groves, who practised
several sorts of divination, jugling, impostures, and delusions,
whereby they were seduced and blinded to follow and worship
the false god and Idols? And from this it is plain that all her
Witchcrafts were only impostures and delusions whereby the people
were led unto idolatry: and so the true signification of this
word is a deceiver and an impostor, and intendeth no other kind
of Witchcraft at all. And in the same sense must the word given
by those we call the Septuagint which is <span lang="grc">τὰ φάρμακα ἀυτῆς</span>, <em>Pharmaca
vel venena sua</em>, her poysons, that is her deceits and delusions
that she set up by the lying Divinations, Juglings, and Impostures
of the Priests, by which the people were seduced, and blinded, and
poysoned with the filthy Doctrine and practice of Idol-worship.
And in the same sense must the words be taken in the Revelation
where the words <span lang="grc">φαρμακεία, φαρμακεὺς, φάρμακος</span> are used. For the Text
saith: <em>And a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great milstone, and
cast it into the sea, saying; Thus with violence shall that great City
Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all</em>. And after:
<em>For thy merchants were the great men of the earth: For by thy sorceries
were all nations deceived</em>. These words are spoken mystically
of spiritual <em>Babylon</em>, in which Antichrist ruleth, who (as the Apostle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>saith) <em>sitteth in the temple of God, and exalteth him self against
all that is called god; and this is he whose coming is after the working
of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders</em>. So that
it is plain that his working being by lying wonders, his Merchants
must needs be lyers and deceivers, and it is these Sorceries, impostures
and delusions by which all Nations are deceived, and caused
to err: and so is no other Witchcraft but meer lying, delusion
and imposture. And to this purpose doth Dr. <em>Hammond</em> Paraphrase
it in these words; speaking of the destruction of <em>Babylon</em>: “And
three eminent causes (he saith) there are of this; First, Luxury
which inriched so many Merchants, and made them so great. Secondly,
seducing other people to their Idolatries and abominable
courses by all arts of insinuation. And thirdly, the persecuting
and slaying of the Apostles and other Christians.” And in the same
sense must this word also be taken in the <em>Galathians</em>, which though
translated Witchcraft, must needs mean imposture, deceit and delusion
by which people are led from the true Doctrine and Worship
of Christ, to vain and lying Superstition and Idolatry, and not
bodily poysoning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Sam. 15. 23.</div>

<p class='c008'>6. Thus far we can find no such Hebrew word as signifieth any
such kind of a Witch as Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>, or Mr. <em>Glanvill</em> intend, or
labour to prove, and therefore we may proceed to the next. Only
we cannot but take notice of one other text, that our English
Translators have erroneously rendered, and that is this: where <em>Samuel</em>
is rebuking <em>Saul</em> for sparing <em>Agag and the best of the spoil</em>, he
saith, <em>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
iniquity and idolatry</em>: Which <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> renders thus: <i><span lang="la">Quin sicut
peccatum divinationis est rebellio: &#38; sicut superstitio &#38; Idola est
repugnantia</span></i>. And <em>Arias Montanus</em> gives it thus: <i><span lang="la">Quia peccatum
divinationis est rebellio, &#38; mendacium vel Idolum, &#38; Teraphim
transgredi</span></i>, which both are agreeable to the Hebrew word <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>קֶסֶם</span> which
signifieth properly Divination. So that this place noteth, not rebellion
against an earthly or temporal King, but against the King of
Heaven; and to disobey his command, and to follow our own wills
and judgments, and to persevere therein, is as odious and detestable,
as to set up lying Divinations thereby to follow Idols and
false gods: for the following the fancies of our own brains, is to
follow the divinations of our own counsel, and to make an Idol,
and a Teraphim of our own frail, weak and blind judgments, and
to forsake the pure and perfect Law of the Lord, which ought to
be a lantern to our feet, and a light unto our paths, and is spiritual
rebellion, even as the divinations of Idol-priests and Idol-worship
were.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. The next Word in this place of <em>Deuteronomy</em> is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>וְחֹבֵר חָבֶר</span> <i><span lang="la">utens
incantatione, vel incantans incantatione, aut jungens junctiones</span></i>,
from the root <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>חָבַר</span> <i><span lang="la">Sociatus est, junctus fuit alteri, copulatus
est</span></i>, for so <em>Avenarius</em> renders it. And <em>Schindlerus</em> saith, <i><span lang="la">Incantator
vel qui consortium habet cum Dæmonibus, conjurator, qui incantationibus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>multa animalia in unum locum consociat vel congregat,
vel ne lædant associat</span></i>. From whence we may note thus much:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chap. 14. 3.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Exod. 36. 10.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. That it primarily signifieth to joyn together, as in that of <em>Genesis</em>
speaking of the Kings that went to War, <em>All these were joyned
together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea</em>. And in another
place, <em>And he coupled the five curtains together</em>; and in the
same sense in diverse other places: by all which it appeareth, that
when it is used for incantation or charming, it is because of some
conjunction or coupling together.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. It is very remarkable that in all the translations in the Polyglot,
there is no variance, neither do <em>Arias Montanus</em>, <em>Buxtorsius</em>,<a id='t117'></a>
or <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> differ at all, and the Greek Translators do agree with
them, who render it, <span lang="grc">ἐπαείδων ἐπαοιδὴν</span>, and the Germane, Low-dutch,
French, and Italian Translators do accord herewithal, and it is
likewise so rendered in <em>Isa.</em> 47. 9, 12. and in other places. So that
it is plain it signifieth such as took upon them by strange words and
charms to prevent venemous beasts to hurt, bite or sting, and many
other wonderful things; but what they brought to pass, or effected,
besides deluding and deceiving of the people and leading
of them to Idolatry, is hard to determine, of which we shall speak in
another place.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. There are divers opinions concerning this incantation or charming,
why it should be accounted conjunction, or association; and
some, as <em>Schindlerus</em> and <em>Bithner</em>, do judge it is because they associate
or bring together many Serpents or noysom Creatures into one
place, and then destroy them. But this is but a conjecture, for it
is by the best learned strongly disputed on both sides, whether
charms and inchantments can really and truly perform any such effects,
and divers instances and examples brought both ways, some
for the affirmative, some for the negative, so that the matter of fact
is not certainly known or granted. Others by association do understand,
the league or compact made betwixt the Charmer and the
Devil, by virtue of which such strange things are brought to pass
by them, and of this opinion was Mr. <em>Perkins</em> (if that Book of
Witchcraft, that goeth under his name, be truly his) who strengthening
his conceit with that verse in the <em>58 Psalm</em> thought that he had
found out an invincible argument to prove the Compact betwixt
Witches and Devils, and therefore it is necessary and expedient to
examine that text to the bottom to sift out the true translation, and
sense of that place, which we shall do at large as followeth in these
particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Our English Translators render it thus, speaking of the deaf
Adder or Asp; <em>Which will not hearken to the voice of the charmers,
charming never so wisely</em>; and in the margent, or <em>be the Charmer
never so cunning</em>, where they take no notice of the conjoyning
of conjunctions, and consequently none of such a league or compact.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> gives it thus: <i><span lang="la">Quæ non auscultat voci mussitantium,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>utentis incantationibus peritissimi</span></i>, which piece of Latine were very
difficult to put into perfect Grammatical construction, because
<em>mussitantium</em> is the plural number, but <i><span lang="la">utentis</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">peritissimi</span></i> are of
the singular, which we shall leave to the censure of Criticks, and
give the marginal note that is there added. <i><span lang="la">Surdæ id est, calidè
agentis adversus incantamenta, ut sequentia exponunt, nam aurem
utramq; ab ea obturari</span></i>, &#38;c. Of the deaf Adder “That is to say, that
acteth craftily against the incantations, as the following words do
expound: For she stoppeth both her ears, by fixing one to the
earth, and covering, and stopping the other with her tail;” and
that <em>Hierome</em>, <em>Augustine</em>, <em>Cassiodorus</em>, and others do so expound
the place. Whether this be true of the Asp or not is much to be
doubted, for I find no Author of credit that doth averr it of his
own knowledge, and the thing is very difficult to bring to experiment,
and the Psalmist might speak according to vulgar opinion,
of which there was no necessity that it should be literally and certainly
true. Further he goes on and saith, <em>mussitantium</em> “That is to
say, pronouncing their incantations to charm her, whispering and
very low; which study of charming, lest any should think that
<em>David</em> doth approve of them in this place, he learnedly useth the
very words of the prohibition, which God laid down <em>Deut.</em> 18.
11. For (he saith) these fascinators in the Hebrew appellation
are said to consociate society, because they apply the society
of the Devil to their arts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Those we call the Septuagint do render it thus: <span lang="grc">Ἥτις οὐκ εἰσκούσεται
φωνὴν επᾳδόντων, φαρμάκου τε φαρμακευομένου παρὰ σοφοῦ</span>. And that which
is ascribed to <em>Hierome</em> in the eight Tome of his works printed at <em>Basil</em>
1525, gives two Latine versions to this, the one answering to the
Septuagint which is this: <i><span lang="la">Quæ non exaudiet vocem incantantium
&#38; venefici incantantis sapienter</span></i>. The other according to the Hebrew
thus, <i><span lang="la">Ut non audiat vocem murmurantium, nec incantatoris
incantationes callidas</span></i>. So that this maketh the meaning to be,
that the deaf Asp is so cunning in stopping of her ear, that she doth not
hear the voice of those that murmur, and mutter charms, though
it be a Charmer that uttereth the most cunning and powerful
charms: So that here is no regard had to conjoyning or associating
either of Serpents together, or of the society of the Charmer and
the Devil.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. <em>Luthers</em> Translation of this place is remarkable, which is this,
<span class='blackletter'><span lang="de">Dass sie nicht hoere die stimme dess Zauberers, dess Beschwerers
der wol besch weren kan</span></span>.<a id='t118'></a> Which in English runs thus, That doth
not hear the voice of the Magicians or Charmers, the Conjurors
or Exorcists, that well conjure can. And agreeable to this is the
translation of the Low-Dutch. So that the sense is, that the deaf Asp
stoppeth her ear against the voice of the Charmers, those that have
sworn together (it may be that common error and opinion had prevailed
so far with learned <em>Luther</em>, as doth appear by his exposition
upon the third Chapter to the <em>Galathians</em>, that he believed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the Witch, and the Devil were in compact, and sworn together) and
that were most cunning in that art. But this doth but in a manner
beg the question, not prove it, for all will but amount to this, that
the Asp cannot be charmed, no not by those that have the
greatest skill in the matter of incantation.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The French Translators render it thus: <i><span lang="fr">Lequel n’écoute point
la voix des enchanteurs, ni du charmeur fort expert en charmes</span></i>,
Which will in no point hear the voice of the inchanter, nor of the
Charmer that is expert in charms. And this proveth nothing at all
of joyning societies, nor of compacts. The Italian version giveth
it thus, <i><span lang="it">Accioche non oda la voce de glivoce incantatori, del venefico
incantante incantationi di dotto</span></i>. In English thus, Which doth not
hear the voice of the inchanter, of the Witch (if that be the signification
of the word <i><span lang="la">venefico</span></i>, a poysoner) inchanting with the incantation
of the learned: And this is most near the Hebrew of all
the rest, and beareth thus much, That the Asp doth not hearken to
the voice of the inchanter, of the Charmer which useth the charms
that were framed and conjoyned by a learned Clerk: so that if associating
be comprised, it must be understood of the framing and
joyning of the charms, which doubtless was the composure of
those that were very learned, especially if they work by a natural
operation, of which we shall discourse hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. But now we come to the Hebrew itself, which <em>Arias Montanus</em>
renders thus, <i><span lang="la">Quæ non audiet ad vocem mussitantium: jungentis
conjunctiones docti</span></i>. And in the margent thus, <i><span lang="la">Quæ non obtemperabit
voce incantantium, incantantis incantationes sapienter</span></i>.
Which we may thus English, Which hearkeneth not to the voice of
the mutterers, of the learned joyner of conjunctions. And the other
thus; Which obeyeth not the voice of the Charmers, of
the person charming charms wisely. So that it may mean, that the
Asp hearkeneth not to the voice of those that mutter or mussitate
the charms of the Charmer that doth wisely use them, or of him
that is a wise Charmer. But it is needless and improper to make an
half period at <em>mussitantium</em>, for then there will be no coherence
in Grammatical construction betwixt the former and latter part of
the verse: and therefore according to the order of Grammar, it should
be rendered thus: <i><span lang="la">Quæ non audiet ad vocem mussitantium incantationes,
docti incantantis</span></i>. And so the meaning is plainly this, that the
Asp doth not hearken to the voice of those that mutter the charms
of a learned Charmer. And so there is no intimation of association
or compact either one way or another, but it doth meerly imply
that the Asp doth resist and frustrate the charms of the mutterers
that use them, though they be wise in the using of them, which
doubtless is the most genuine rendring, and the true meaning of
the place: or else it may be thus aptly translated: <i><span lang="la">Quæ non audiet
ad vocem mussitantium conjunctiones jungentis docti</span></i>; That is thus,
Which hearkeneth not to the voice of those that mutter the Conjunctions
of a learned Joyner. So this way the sense will be, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>she resisteth the Charms, or Conjunctions of the learned Joyner or
Framer of them, and consequently that it hath not respect, either
to the associating or gathering of the Asps into one place, or an
association or compact betwixt the Charmer and the Devil, which
are both beg’d, and too far fetcht, and cannot be intended properly
in this Metaphor. But it (if thus Translated according to <em>Arias
Montanus</em>) referreth punctually and properly to the cunning and
wise composure of the letters and words used in the Charm, that
if they had been never so cunningly contrived, or joyned together by
those that had the greatest skill of all others in framing and composing
of charms; yet were they utterly inefficacious against this
kind of Serpent. And so we conclude this, having as yet found no
such Hebrew word as signifieth a Witch in the vulgar sense and
common acceptation.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Another word that followeth in this place of <em>Deuteronomy</em> is
<span lang='he' dir='rtl'>וְשֹׁאֵל אוֹב</span><a id='t120'></a> <i><span lang="la">requirens Pythonem</span></i>, which what it meaneth is more obscured,
and erroneously translated, than any of the rest. And
this our English Translators have ignorantly or wilfully, but
however erroneously rendered in all the places where it is used, to
be one that hath a familiar spirit. From whence note these things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Job 32.19.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. This word, as <em>Buxtorsius</em>, <em>Schindlerus</em>, and <em>Avenarius</em> observe,
hath two significations, the one is, <em>uter vel lagena</em>, the other <em>Python</em>,
and so saith learned <em>Masius</em>, <i><span lang="la">significat vero vox Ob utrem vel
lagenam</span></i>; “From whence the Jewish Nation did call those Devils
which did give answers forth of the parts of Men and Womens
Bodies, <em>Ob</em>, and in the plural number <em>Oboth</em>; As it is only once for
bottles used in that of <em>Job</em>, <em>Behold, my belly is as wine that hath
no vent, it is ready to burst like new bottles</em>.” And to the same purpose
speaketh <em>Schindlerus</em> in these words: “From thence it seemeth
to be called <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>אוב</span> <em>Pytho</em>, because those that had it, or were
possessed with it, being puft up with wind, did swell like blown
bladders, and the unclean spirit being interrogated did forth of their
bellies give answers of things past, present, and to come, from whence
also they were called <span lang="grc">ἐγγαστρίμυθος</span>, <em>ventriloqui</em>, speakers in the belly,
or out of the belly.” So that in the sense of these men, it was a Devil
or Spirit that spoke in them, as though they had been essentially
and substantially possest with a Demon; so prone were they to
ascribe all things (almost) unto the Devils power, not considering
that they had no other Devil, but that of Imposture and Delusion,
as we shall shew anon with unanswerable arguments.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The most or all the translations in the Polyglott do render it
<i><span lang="la">Pythonem, vel spiritum Pythonis</span></i> in this place of <em>Deuteronomy</em>, and
other places: But what is to be understood by <em>Python</em>, or the Spirit
of <em>Python</em> is as difficult to find out, as the meaning of the Hebrew
word <em>Ob</em>, because it must be digged forth of the rubbish of
Grecian lies: For some will have it to be derived from the word
<span lang="grc">απὸ τοῦ πυνθάνεσθαι</span>, <i><span lang="la">à consulendi &#38; interrogandi usu</span></i>. But that they
were called so rather from the Epithete given to <em>Apollo</em>, who (as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the Poets fabled) did soon after <em>Deucalions</em> flood slay the Dragon
<em>Python</em>, <span lang="grc">πύθων</span>, so called a <span lang="grc">πύθεσθαι</span> <i><span lang="la">quod est putrescere</span></i>, because he was
said to be bred of the putrefaction of the Earth; and so he was
called <i><span lang="la">Apollo Pythius</span></i>, and those that kept the Oracle at <em>Delphos</em>,
and gave answers, were called <em>Pythii vates</em>, and the Oracles <i><span lang="la">Oracula
Pythia</span></i>: as may be seen in <em>Plutarch</em>, <em>Thucydides</em>, and <em>Lucian</em>:
and <em>Suidas</em> and <em>Hesychius</em> say, <span lang="grc">Πύθων</span> <i><span lang="la">dicebatur etiam Dæmonium cujus

was called <em>Pythius</em>, and those that kept his Oracle at <em>Delphos</em> were
called <em>Pythios vates</em>, Pythian Priests, or Diviners of <em>Python</em>. So
that all that can be gathered from hence is, that to have the Spirit
of <em>Python</em>, was to undertake such Divinations, as the Priests used
at the Pythian Oracle at <em>Delphos</em>, and that was no more in truth and

<p class='c008'>3. Those that we call the Septuagint expressing the manner of
the performance of this kind of Imposture do (as <em>Masius</em> confesseth,
and is true) constantly call them by the name of <span lang="grc">ἐγγαστριμύθους</span>, because
they did speak forth of their Breasts or Bellies, that was by turning
their voices backwards down their Throats, which some of the
Latines imitating the Greek word have not unfitly called them <em>ventriloquos</em>,
that is, speaking in their Bellies. And that there were
such in ancient times is witnessed by <em>Plutarch</em>, who saith, speaking
of the ceasing of Oracles, thus: “That it is alike foolish and
childish to judge that God himself, as the <em>Engastrimuthoi</em>, (that
is to say, the <em>Genii</em> hariolating forth of the Belly) which in
times past they did call <em>Eurycleas</em>, now <em>Pythonas</em>, hiding himself
in the Bodies of the Prophets, and using their mouth and voice
as instruments, should speak.” From whence we may note these
things. 1. That in <em>Plutarch</em> time who lived in the Reign of <em>Trajan</em>,
there were of these persons that could speak (as it were)
forth of their Bellies. 2. That though <em>Plutarch</em> was a very learned,
sagacious person, yet he either knew not, or else concealed the
manner how these <em>ventriloquists</em> performed this speaking, in their
Breasts or Bellies, it being nothing but a cheat and artificial imposture,
as we shall shew anon, of whom his learned Translator <em>Adrianus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Turnebus</em>, and of these vanities speaketh thus. “Therefore
(he saith) we condemn all sorts of Divinations which are not received
from the sacred writings, and do judge them to have been
found out, either by the craftiness of men or the wickedness of
Devils; but we rejoice to our selves that being Divinely taught,
we here see far more than the most learned <em>Plutarch</em> did, who beheld
but little light in this his disputation of the defect of Oracles.”
3. We may note that these words (that is to say, the <em>Genii</em> hariolating
forth of the Belly) which we have inclosed in a <em>Parenthesis</em>,
are not found in the Greek written by <em>Plutarch</em>, but are only added
as the conjecture of <em>Turnebus</em>. 4. <em>Plutarch</em> doth hold it childish
to believe that God doth hide himself and speak in the belly of
these couzening Diviners, and therein though an Heathen was wiser
than many that profess Christianity now, who believe it to be some
Spirit, when it is nothing but the cunning Imposture of those persons,
that by use have learned that artifice of turning their voices
back into their Throats and Breasts. 5. As to matter of fact it is
manifest that in the time of <em>Plutarch</em> there were those that practised
this cunning trick thereby to get credit or money by the pretence
of Predictions and Divinations, and such an one doubtless was the
Woman at <em>Endor</em>, and the Maid mentioned in the <em>Acts</em> of the Apostles,
of which we shall speak presently.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Antiq.</em> <em>lect.</em> 8. 10.</div>

<p class='c008'>Also <em>Tertullian</em> a grave Author, affirmeth that he had seen such
Women that were Ventriloquists, from whole secret parts a small
voice was heard as they sate, and did give answers to things asked.
And so <em>Cælius Rhodiginus</em> doth write that he often saw a Woman
Ventriloquist at <em>Rhodes</em>, and in a City of <em>Italy</em> his own Country,
from whose secrets he had often heard a very slender voice of an
unclean Spirit, but very intelligible, tell strangely of things past or
present, but of things to come for the most part uncertain, and
also often vain and lying; which doth plainly demonstrate that it
was but an humane artifice, and a designed Imposture.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>c.</em> 14. <em>p.</em>

<p class='c008'>“But most notable is that story related by <em>Wierus</em> from the mouth
of his Sons who had it from the mouth of <i><span lang="la">Adrianus Turnebus</span></i>,
who did openly profess that before-time he had seen at <em>Paris</em> a
crafty fellow very like <em>Euricles</em> mentioned by <em>Aristophanes</em>, who
was called <em>Petrus Brabantius</em>, who as oft as he would, could
speak from the lower part of his Body, his Mouth being open, but
his Lips not moved, and that he did deceive many all over by
this cunning, which whether it be to be called an art, or exercitation,
or the imposture of the Devil is to be doubted. And
further relateth that at <em>Paris</em> he deceived a Widow Woman
and got her to give him her Daughter in Marriage, who had a
great Portion; by counterfeiting that his so speaking in his Breast,
or Belly, was the voice of her deceased Husband, who was in
Purgatory, and could not be loosed thence, except she gave her
Daughter in Marriage unto him: By which deceitful knavery
he got her, and about six Months after, when he had spent all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>her Portion, the Wife and Mother-in-law being left, he fled to
<em>Lions</em>: And there hearing that a very rich Merchant was dead, who
was accounted living a very wicked man, who had gotten his riches
by right and wrong; this <em>Brabantius</em> goeth to his Son called <em>Cornutus</em>,
who was walking in a Grove or Orchard behind the
Church-yard, and intimateth that he was sent to teach him what
was fit for him to do. But while that he telleth him that he
ought rather to think of the Soul of his Father, than of his
Fame, or Death; upon the suddain while they speak together a
voice is heard—imitating his Father’s: Which voice although <em>Brabantius</em>
did give out of his Belly, yet he did in a wonderful manner
counterfeit to tremble: But <em>Cornutus</em> was admonished by this
voice, into what state his Father was faln by his injustice, and
with what great torments he was tortured in Purgatory, both for
his own, and his Sons cause, for that he had left him the Heir of
so much ill gotten goods, and that he could be freed by no
means, unless by a just expiation made by the Son, and some considerable
part of his goods distributed to charitable uses unto
those that stood most need, such as were Christians made Captives
with the Turks. Whereupon he gave credit to <em>Brabantius</em>,
with whom he discoursed, as a Man that was to be sent by Godly
persons to <em>Constantinople</em> to redeem the prisoners, and that he was
sent unto him by Divine Power for the same purpose. But <em>Cornutus</em>,
though a Man no way evil; and although having heard
these things, he understood not the deceit: yet notwithstanding
because of the word, that he should part with so much money,
made answer that he would consider of it, and willeth <em>Brabantius</em>
to repair the day following to the same place. In the mean
time being staggered in his thoughts he did much doubt, in respect
of the place, where he had heard the voice, because it was
shadowy, and dark, and subject to the crafty treacheries of Men,
and to the Eccho. Therefore the next day he leadeth <em>Brabantius</em>
into another open plain place, neither troubled with shadows
nor bushes. Where notwithstanding the same tale was repeated,
during their discourse, that he had heard before: This also being
added, that forthwith six thousand Franks should be given to
<em>Brabantius</em>, that three Masses might be said every day, to redeem
his Father forth of Purgatory; otherwayes that there could be
no redemption for him. And thereupon the Son obliged both by
conscience and religion, although unwillingly, delivers so many
to the trust of <em>Brabantius</em>; all lawful evidence of the agreement
and performance being utterly neglected. The Father freed from
the fire and torments afterwards hath rested quiet, and by speaking
did not trouble the Son any more. But the wretched <em>Cornutus</em>,
after <em>Brabantius</em> was gone, being one time more pleasant
than wonted, which made his Table-companions much to wonder;
and forthwith opening the cause to them inquiring it, he
was forthwith so derided of all, because that in his judgment he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>had been so beguiled, and cheated of his money besides, that
within few days after he died for plain grief, and so followed his
Father to know the truth of that thing of him.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist.</em> 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>But to make this more plain and certain, we shall add a Story of
a notable Impostor, or Ventriloquist, from the testimony of Mr. <em>Ady</em>;
which we have had confirmed from the mouth of some Courtiers
that both saw and knew him, and is this: “It hath been (saith he)
credibly reported, that there was a Man in the Court, in King
<em>James</em> his days, that could act this imposture so lively, that he
could call the King by name, and cause the King to look round
about him wondering who it was that called him, whereas he that
called him stood before him in his presence, with his face towards
him: but after this Imposture was known, the King in his merriment
would sometimes take occasion by this Impostor to make sport upon
some of his Courtiers, as for instance; There was a Knight
belonging to the Court, whom the King caused to come before
him in his private room (where no Man was but the King, and this
Knight, and the Impostor) and feigned some occasion of serious
discourse with the Knight; but when the King began to speak,
and the Knight bending his attention to the King, suddenly there
came a voice as out of another room, calling the Knight by name,
Sir <em>John</em>, Sir <em>John</em>, come away Sir <em>John</em>; at which the King began
to frown that any Man should be so unmannerly as to molest the
King and him: And still listning to the Kings discourse, the voice
came again, Sir <em>John</em>, Sir <em>John</em>, come away, and drink off your
Sack; at that Sir <em>John</em> began to swell with anger, and looked
into the next rooms to see who it was that dared to call him so
importunately, and could not find out who it was, and having
chid with whomsoever he found he returned again to the King.
The King had no sooner begun to speak as formerly, but the
voice came again, Sir <em>John</em>, come away, your Sack stayeth for you.
At that Sir <em>John</em> began to stamp with madness, and looked out,
and returned several times to the King, but could not be quiet
in his discourse with the King, because of the voice that so often
troubled him, till the King had sported enough.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist.</em> 3.</div>

<p class='c008'>I my self also have seen a young man about 16 or 17 years of age,
who having learned at School, and having no great mind to his
Book, fell into an Ague; in the declination of which he seemed to
be taken with convulsion-fits, and afterwards to fall into Trances,
and at the last to speak (as with another small voice) in his Breast
or Throat, and pretended to declare unto those that were by, what
sinful and knavish tricks they had formerly acted, or what others
were doing in remote places and rooms. So that presently his
Father and the Family with the neighbourhood were perswaded
that he was possest, and that it was a spirit that spoke in him,
which was soon heightned by Popish reports all over the Countrey.
But there being a Gentleman of great note and understanding his Kinsman
caused him to be sent over unto me, to have mine opinion whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>it were a natural distemper or not. The Father and the Boy
with an old cunning Woman (the made creature to cry up the certainty
of his possession, and the verity of a spirit speaking in him)
came unto me, who all appeared to my judgment and best reason
fit persons to act any designed Imposture. The Father having been
one that had lived profusely, and spent the most of his means, being
sufficiently prophane and irreligious: The Boy by his face
appearing to be of a melancholy complexion, and of a subtile
and crafty disposition; the Woman cunning, who would have forced
me to believe whatsoever he related, thinking to impose upon
me as she had done upon others. I presently judged it to be neither
natural disease, nor supernatural distemper, but only knavery and
Imposture, and so made the Woman silent, and told her she was a cheater,
and deserved due punishment, and that what she told, were the
most of them lies of her own inventing; and told the Father and
the Son that I could soon cast forth all the Devils that he was possessed
with; but then I must have him in mine own custody, and none
of them to come near him nor to speak with him. A long time
I expected to have seen him in one of his fits, but his Devil was too
timerous of my stern countenance and rough carriage. Well after
they three had consulted together, the Lad by no means could be
gotten to stay with me, no not for that night, nor be prevailed
with again to be brought into my presence; but away they went
the Lad riding behind his Father, and when about a quarter of a
mile from the Town the Father turned the Horse to come back again
unto me, the Lad leapt from off the Horse, and run away crying from
the Townwards as fast as he could. They went that night to a Popish
House where were concourse of people sufficient, and many
tales told of the Divinations of the spirit in the Boy, but not one
word either of me or against me. Soon after the Gentleman that
was of kin to the Boy came over, and I gave him satisfaction that
it was a contrived cheat, and after he returned, he would have
prevailed with them to have sent the Boy to me, but by no means
could effect it; and so he never after gave any regard unto them,
and soon after it vanished to nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>I my self also knew a person, in the West-riding of <em>Yorkshire</em>,
who about some forty years or above, to have made sport, would
have put a Coverlet upon him, and then would have made any believe
(that knew not the truth) that he had a child with him, he
would so lively have discoursed with two voices, and have imitated
crying and the like. And also the said person under a Coverlet,
and coming upon all four would so exceeding aptly, even to the
life, have acted a skirmish betwixt two Mastiffs, both by grinning,
snarling and all other motions and noise, that divers understanding
persons have been deceived and verily believed that there were two
Mastiffs under the Coverlet, until their eyes have convinced them of
their error: So delusive may art or cunning be, being seconded by use
and agility.</p>

a voluntary cheat and a delusive Imposture, as may be seen at large
in <em>Stowes</em> Chronicle. We have been thus tedious in giving these examples,

<p class='c008'>4. Next the more fully to explain this we may consider the place
in the <em>Acts</em> which is rendred thus, <span lang="grc">Παιδίσκην τινὰ ἔχουσαν πνεῦμα Πύθωνος</span>
of which the learned and judicious <em>Isaac Casaubon</em> saith thus: “An
ancient interpreter readeth <span lang="grc">Πόθωνα</span>, and the <em>Syrian</em> version rendereth
<i><span lang="la">spiritum divinationis</span></i>. It may be quere’d, seeing <em>Apollo</em> is
understood, why S. <em>Luke</em> doth use the Epithete of him rather than
the proper name: And the reason is because the ancients did call
the Ventriloquists <span lang="grc">Πύθωνες</span> Pythonists.” And it is plain that it
was Divination, that was telling of secret things, whether past,
present or to come, that the Maid pretended and undertook: for
the text saith, <em>Which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying</em>;
<span lang="grc">μαντευομένη</span>, that is, by Vaticination. <em>Beza</em> in his Latine translation
saith in his Marginal Notes, “That that Spirit of Oracling,
was only an expression alluding to the Idol <em>Apollo</em>, which was
called <em>Python</em>, and gave answers unto them that asked, namely,
by the Priests that belonged unto it, of which Idol the Poets
feigned many things; so that they that had the Imposture of Divination
were said by the Heathen to be inspired by the spirit of
<em>Apollo</em>. And in this place of the <em>Acts</em>, S. <em>Luke</em> speaketh after the
common Phrase of the Heathen, because he delivereth the error
of the common people, but not by what instinct the Maid gave
Divinations; for it is certain that under the Mask of that Idol,
the Devil plaid his deluding pranks, and this spirit of <em>Apollo</em> was
nothing, but as much as to say, an Imposture, or deluding trick
of the Devil practised by the Priests of <em>Apollo</em>.” So much saith <em>Beza</em>,
who plainly expoundeth, “That that Spirit of Divination or
Oracling, was only a Devilish deluding Imposture, and not a familiar
Devil as many do fondly imagine: And whereas it is
said in the verse following, that S. <em>Paul</em> did cast that Spirit out of
the Maid, it was, that he by the power of the Gospel of <em>Jesus</em> rebuked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>her wickedness: so that her Conscience being terrified, she
was either converted, or else at the least dared not to follow that
deluding craft of Divination any longer: as when Christ did cast
out seven Devils out of <em>Mary Magdalen</em>, it is to be understood
that he did convert her from many devilish sinful courses in which
she had walked.” Thus far learned <em>Beza</em> and Mr. <em>Ady</em>, who both
seem to understand no other Demon in the case than only a crafty
and devilish Imposture and Cheat, and most certainly it could be
nothing else.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Kings 10. 18, to 26.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. But to come to the stress of the business, these things are to
be considered. 1. Some thought that they were really, and essentially
possessed with an evil spirit that did speak in them and gave
forth answers, and this is the most common, though most false opinion:
which if it were true, it maketh nothing for those familiars
that are ascribed to our Witches, for by that they mean a visible
Devil without them in the shape of a Dog, a Cat or the like, and
both these are equally absurd and false, as we shall shew anon.
2. Some thought that an evil spirit <i><span lang="la">ab extra</span></i> did but work upon
their minds, and so inspired them with these Divinations, and this
seems to have been the opinion of <em>Plutarch</em> and some others of
the Heathen. 3. But others (which is that which we affirm) did
hold that they were but counterfeiting deluding Impostors, and
what they did was only by Ventriloquy, Jugling and confederacy,
and that all their pretended Divinations and predictions, were nothing
but lying conjectures and ambiguous equivocations. But to
open it fully we must conceive that they did pretend and take upon
them to foretel and declare things to come, which notwithstanding
were but false forgeries and lies: for if they had really
had any certain foreknowledge of things to come, then when <em>Jehu</em>
was made King, and in subtilty pretended to sacrifice to <em>Baal</em>, and
so got together all the Priests to sacrifice, if these base, lying, cheating
Impostors had really had any skill in Divination, then they
might have known, that their calling together was not truly to
advance their Idolatry, but to take away their lives; and it may
safely be concluded that those that could not foresee the danger
threatning their own lives, could not truly foretel contingent effects
to others; and though the Scripture give us many such examples
as these, yet to eschew prolixity this may suffice to evince that
all their pretended predictions were nothing but conjectures, or lying
forgeries.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as they did take upon them to foretel things to come, so
this Woman of <em>Endor</em>, and in likelihood the rest, did pretend to do it
by raising up, or causing to ascend those that were dead to give answers
of the things demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now therefore the state of the question will be, whether this
Woman had really a familiar or supernatural spirit that gave her
answers, or that she raised such an one, or that only she was a deceiver
and Impostor that could cast her self into a Trance, and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>speak in her Breast, or that she had a place contrived for the purpose
(as they had at the Oracle at <em>Delphos</em>) by which means she
could speak, as in a Bottle or hollow cavity, and had other Confederates
sutably fitted to accomplish her design. Here we shall only
speak as to the significancy of the words relating to this matter,
and shall handle the History of the matter of fact elsewhere: And
in the first place we allow and grant that she had the cooperating
power of the Devil, in her mind and will, leading her to take upon
her to foretel things to come, of which she was utterly ignorant:
so that we grant her under a spiritual league with the Devil,
as all wicked persons are, but we deny that she had any other
familiar spirit, but only the spirit of delusion and Imposture, as we
shall make good by these arguments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Sam. 28. 9.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 29. 4.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Because the word sometimes signifieth the persons pretending
to be skilful in this sort of Divinations; for so the Woman saith
unto <em>Saul</em>: <em>Behold thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath
cut off</em> <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>הָאבוֹת</span><a id='t128'></a> <em>Pythones</em>, that is, the persons that pretended, and
practised that kind of Divination. And so again in that of <i><span lang="la">Isaiah:
And thy voice shall be</span></i> <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>כְּאוֹב</span> <i><span lang="la">sicut Pythonis</span></i> as the voice of one that
useth this kind of Divination. So that it is clear that the act is
ascribed unto, and was performed by the persons practising this
couzening craft, and not unto a familiar or Devil.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Sometimes it is taken for the means that they pretended they
performed it by, as in <em>Sauls</em> deluded and despairing sense; for he
saith, <i><span lang="la">Divina quæso mihi</span></i> <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>כְּאוֹב</span> <i><span lang="la">in Pythone, vel per Pythonem, and
cause to ascend whom I shall name unto thee</span></i>. So that he vainly thought
that she could call up, and make to ascend whomsoever he should
name, so blind and deluded was he when the spirit of the Lord was
departed from him, and was justly delivered up to believe lies, because
he had not received the love of the truth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nahum 3. 4.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. It doth not appear that she had any familiar spirit, or called
up any; for the name that is there given her is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>בַּעֲלַת אוֹב</span> <i><span lang="la">Dominam
Pythonis vel utris</span></i>; the Mistriss of the Bottle, or of the Oracle,
for Saul saith, seek me a Woman that is Mistriss of the Bottle,
or of the Oracle, for so it must signifie, if it be genuinely and fitly
translated; and his servants tell him, that at <em>Endor</em> there is a Woman
that was Mistriss of <em>Ob</em>, the Bottle or Oracle. For though some
translate it <i><span lang="la">mulier habens Pythonem</span></i>, or as <i><span lang="la">Tremellius, mulier prædita
Pythone</span></i>, it will but reach thus much, that she was possessed of or
had in her power, this <em>Ob</em>, Bottle, or Oracle, that could be nothing
but the fit contrived place to give answers, as they did at the Oracle.
For if they meant that she had a familiar spirit in her Belly,
then it was possest of her, more than she could be said to be possest
of it. But there is another Text that doth fully agree with this, and
will help to explicate it, and is this, speaking of the destruction of
<em>Nineveh</em> or the Jewish Nation, and the causes of it: <em>Because of the
multitude of the whoredoms of the welfavoured harlot, the Mistriss
of Witchcrafts</em>, <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>בַּעֲלַת כְּשָׁפִים</span>, <i><span lang="es">Domina vel patrona</span></i>, the Mistriss, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Patroness of Juglings and delusions. So that in propriety of language
she of <em>Endor</em> is called the Mistriss of <em>Python</em> or Oracle, because
she could play the couzening feats that belonged unto it.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Amongst all the several ways of Idolatry that <em>Manasseh</em> set up,
or caused to be set up, this is one <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>וְעָשָׂה אוֹב</span>,<a id='t129'></a> <i><span lang="la">&#38; fecit Pythonem</span></i>, or
<em>fecissetq; Pythonem</em>, he made <em>Ob</em>, or <em>Pytho</em>; and though Translators
have been much perplexed, and hard put to it, to give a signification
agreeable to their preconceived opinion, yet have they,
were it right or wrong, brought it to their minds, though it be
utterly false and erroneous; for <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> renders it, <i><span lang="la">instituitq;
Pythonem</span></i>, which though pretty near, yet is altogether short of the
propriety, and the most of the rest have run quite Counter; but
our English Translators the worst of all others, who give it, <em>and
dealt with a familiar spirit</em>. When it is plain that this word must
be taken in this place, as it is in the third verse of this Chapter, <em>he
made groves</em>, <em>fecitq; lucos</em>, because the words are both from the
same root which is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>עָשָׂה</span> <i><span lang="la">fecit</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">confecit</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">perfecit</span></i>, and so it is, and
must be taken in other places; and is especially manifest in these.
<em>God said to Noah, make thee an Ark of Gopher wood</em>, and after, <em>a
window shalt thou make to the Ark</em>. The Psalmist saith: <em>But our
God is in heaven, he hath done whatsoever he pleased</em>, and again,
<em>To him who alone doth great wonders</em>. We might add forty places
more, where the word is used that cometh from this root and hath
the same punctual signification; so that from hence we may conclude,
1. That <em>Manasseh</em> could not make a Devil nor a Spirit, and
therefore that the word <em>Ob</em> doth not intend nor bear forth any such
matter in true and genuine signification. 2. That he could not
make a Man or Woman, and therefore the word properly doth
signifie neither. 3. That he only could make, and cause to be
contrived the Groves, in such an order, as the Idol-Priests might
direct, as most fit for them to play their couzening and Jugling
feats and delusions in. So he might make or cause to be contrived
the <span lang="grc">μαντείον</span> or place for the Oracle, and prepare those knacks and
implements, wherewith and in which place the Diviner might either
by him, or her self, or with the help of confederates bring
to pass strange things, which they made the blind and ignorant
people believe were performed by the God worshipped in and by
those Idols, or by Demons and Spirits, or the calling up of the
dead. When in truth there was nothing at all performed, but either
in raptures, feigned and forced Furies, Trances; and thereby
lying predictions and ambiguous equivocations were uttered, whereby
the people were deluded and drawn unto Idolatry: or by giving
dark and obscure responsions by Ventriloquy, speaking in Bottles,
or through hollow Pipes and cavities, whereby they did peep
and mutter; or lastly by having knavish confederates hidden in
secret, and cunningly contrived places, and suitably habited to personate
those that were desired to be raised up, as is most probable
in this Woman of <em>Endor</em> and the forged and pretended <em>Samuel</em>: So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>that there was no Devil nor familiar but a couzening Knave or a
Quean, more crafty than the Demons themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. That they had no familiar Spirit is manifest, if we consider the
manner how they carried themselves in these cheating actions and
performances, for the Prophet tells us thus: <em>And when they shall
say unto you, seek unto</em> <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>הָאֹבוֹת</span> <i><span lang="la">ad Pythones</span></i>, unto Oraclers, and
unto Wizards that peep, and mutter; If they had a familiar Spirit
or Demon, what need they chirp, peep, or mutter? could it not
speak loud and plain enough? Yea doubtless it could if they had
any such, but it is to conceal their own deceit and knavery, lest
it should be found forth and discovered: And without such chirping
and muttering they could neither perform their Jugling delusions,
nor keep them from being known, and derided. <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>
his note upon this place is very remarkable: “The Prophet (saith
he) aggravateth the heinous crime of those Witches from the vanity
of those Divinations, which the very manner of them betrayeth:
those seducers have not so much wit, that they dare speak
to the people the thing they pretend to speak in plain and open
terms, with an audible clear voice, as they that are Gods Prophets,
who speak the word of God as loud as may be, and as
plain as they can to the people; but they chirp in their Bellies,
and very low in their Throats, like Chickens half out of the
shells in their hatching.” And this doth plainly declare their
knavery and cheating Juglings. The same Prophet in another place
speaking of the destruction, and bringing low of <em>Jerusalem</em> he saith:
<em>And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground,
and thy speech shall be low out of the dust. And thy voice shall be as
of a</em> Pythonist, <em>Ob</em>, or as of an Oracler, <em>out of the ground, and thy
speech shall whisper</em>, peep or chirp <em>out of the dust</em>. The word there,
and in the former place used is from the root, <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>צַפְצֵף</span><a id='t130'></a> <em>garrivit more
avium</em>, he hath peeped or chirped like a Bird. Now this doth plainly
allude to these kind of Pythonists, or Oraclers, who in giving
their Oracles, or Divinations, did speak out of the ground, that
was from hollow Vaults and Caves contrived on purpose for them to
perform their tricks in, and such a place as this, called in the Hebrew
<em>Ob</em>, did <em>Manasseh</em> make and prepare, <em>And thy speech shall be
low out of the dust</em>, like these deceivers who fall into Trances, and
lie upon their faces the better to conceal and hide their Impostures,
and so do change their voice, and mutter as it were out of the
dust, thereby to make the people believe that it is the Demon’s or
Spirit’s voice that speaketh in them, when it is nothing but their
own counterfeiting. And thy voice shall be like one of these Oraclers,
out of a low and hollow place, to whisper and chirp like a
Chicken coming forth of the shell, the more to make them believe
that it is the voice of a Spirit, and not their own, by craft and
cunning altered and changed. Upon which place learned and judicious
<em>Calvin</em> saith thus much: “For the voice of them, who before
were so lofty and cruel, he compareth to the speech of <em>Pythonists</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>who when they did utter the Oracles, did give forth I
know not what kind of murmur, from some low and dark place
under the earth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>8. The next word that followeth in this place of <em>Deuteronomy</em> is
<span lang='he' dir='rtl'>יִדְּעֹנִי</span><a id='t131'></a> from the root <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>יָדַע</span> <i><span lang="la">novit, sivit, proprie est</span></i> (<i><span lang="la">ut</span></i> Avenarius <i><span lang="la">inquit</span></i>)
<i><span lang="la">mentis &#38; intellectus</span></i>. Which word our Translators (contrary to
their usual custom) have kept a constancy in, and alwaies have rendered
a Wizard, a name (as we conjecture) not improper, for we,
in the North of <em>England</em>, call such as take upon them to foretel
where things are that have been stoln, or to take upon them to help
Men or Goods, that the vain credulity of the common people have
thought to be bewitched, we (I say) call them Wise Men, or Wise
Women, without regard had to the way or means by which they
undertook to perform these things. Divers others do render it <em>sciolus</em>,
which is proper and consonant to the former. The other
Translations that we have either seen, or were able to understand,
are so uncertain, various, wide and wilde, that it were lost labour
to examine or recite them; and the word Wizard (though a general
one) is the most proper that we can find. But we must conclude,
that hitherto we find no such word as signifieth a Witch in
that sense we have allowed, and endeavoured to confute.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. The last word mentioned in this Text of <em>Deuteronomy</em>, is a
Necromancer, or one that consulteth with the dead. Now whether
this were some special kind of Divination, or but a comprehension
of all the kinds, being but in all their several sorts, a leading
of the people to inquire of dumb and dead Idols, may be a great
and material question. And though no Interpreter or Commentator
that we have seen, read, or do remember, do hint at any such,
matter, but still strike upon the common string, that it should
be some kind of Magick, whereby they could make the dead appear,
and consult with them: yet notwithstanding all this we cannot
but propose our doubts in these reasons following.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. <em>Moses</em> in this Text doubtlesly did not set down all the particular
sorts of Divinations and Impostures used amongst the Heathen,
for that had hardly been possible, but the chiefest kinds of
them. And this is not rationally probable that he would do it by
a Tautology, or repetition of the same thing twice. For inquiring
of the dead, or consulting with them, was intended in the word
<em>Ob</em>, and the Woman of <em>Endor</em> said; <em>Whom shall I raise up</em>, or cause
to ascend unto thee? Whereby it appeareth that she pretended
(and also <em>Saul</em> vainly believed, who said; Divine unto me in or
by <em>Ob</em>) that she could cause the dead to ascend, and to have answers
from them of things to come, as is manifest in the Story of the
pretended apparition and prediction of <em>Samuel</em>. And so this thing
should be twice repeated in this place, which is not probable that
<em>Moses</em> would have done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 44. 19.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. He doth not forbid these several sorts of Divination only because
they were evil and unlawful in themselves (for some of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>might be lawful, and performed by natural or artificial means) but
because of the thing they all centred in, and the end they all tended
to, which was to lead and draw the people to inquire of and
to serve deaf, dumb and dead Idols. For though the Idols were Silver
and Gold, the work of Mens hands, and had eyes and saw not,
<em>ears and heard not, feet and walked not, mouths and spoke not</em>,
neither was there breath in their Nostrils: And though the common
people could not but know this, for as <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i> saith they were
so blinded that, <em>None considereth in his heart, neither is there
knowledge or understanding to say, I have burnt part of it in the fire;
yea also I have baked bread with the coals thereof, I have roasted
flesh and eaten it, and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?
shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?</em> Yet notwithstanding
were they so deluded by the crafty Impostures, and subtile Divinations
of all the several sorts of these Jugling Priests, that they
ran to ask counsel at these dead Idols, who (as they falsly perswaded
the people) did inspire them, and gave them answers, when the
Idols were all dead things, and gave no answers at all. And this
is that consulting with the dead, that all these couzening Priests
did draw the people unto, and therefore in general is here forbidden.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 8. 19.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. The words of the Prophet, where he saith [<em>And when they
shall say unto you, seek unto them that are</em> Ob or Oraclers, <em>and unto
wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto
their God? for the living to the dead?</em>] do fully prove as much;
for the sense must be this: That the people of God ought to seek
unto their own God, who was and is a true and a living God, and to his
Law &#38; Testimonies, and not to those peepers and mutterers that seek
counsel of the dead Idols only; and doubtless this is the true meaning
of consulting the dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. This exposition includeth no absurdity, nor bringeth any inconvenience,
and is genuine, and not wrested; whereas the other
doth hurry in a whole heap of most absurd doubts, questions and
opinions. But if in this exposition we be Heterodoxal, we crave
pardon, and referr it to the judgment of those that are learned, of
what perswasion soever they be.</p>

<span lang='he' dir='rtl'>חַרְטֻמִּים</span>,<a id='t132'></a> which though <em>Avenarius</em> doth derive from <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>חֶרֶט</span> <em>stilus

is of the same opinion, that it is a word strange and foreign from the
Hebrew language. The Translators are all so various about the
proper derivation and signification of it, that it were but lost time
and labour to recite them: But it is manifest that it was a general
word for one that was skilful in all, or divers sorts of these Divinations,
and might best be constantly rendred <em>magos</em>, and that for
these reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Candle in the dark, p. 11.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>1. It is the opinion of <em>Masius</em> and Mr. <em>Ady</em> that it is a general
word, and signifieth one that hath skill in many of these kind of
arts, (if they may be so called) the latter of which saith thus: “It
is taken in the general sense for <em>magus</em> a Magician; that hath one,
or all these crafts or Impostures.” And the former quoting the sentence
of <em>Rabbi Isaac Natar</em>, saith: <i><span lang="la">Hoc nomine vocatos esse ab Hebræis
quosvis, qui inter gentes singularem profitebantur sapientiam;
præsertim cùm ea ad superstitionem pertineret</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Because that in <em>Exodus</em> 7. 13. those that there are called <em>Hachamim</em>
and <em>Mechassephim</em>, that is <i><span lang="la">sapientes &#38; præstigiatores</span></i>, as <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>
renders it, which is most proper and genuine, are there called
<em>Hartummim Mezeraim</em>, that is <em>Magos Ægypti</em>, the Magicians of
<em>Ægypt</em>; by which it appeareth plainly that it is a general name, and
may most properly be rendered a Magician.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. It may most properly be taken for a Magician, because those
that acted before <em>Pharaoh</em> are called by that name, and excepting
their opposing of <em>Moses</em>, and their superstition, it doth not appear
that they dealt with unlawful Magick, as we shall prove undeniably
hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Sam. 12. 19.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Psal. 41. 7.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 26. 16.</div>

<p class='c008'>11. There is also another word which is used in divers places,
which is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>לָחַשׁ</span><a id='t133'></a> <em>mussitavit</em>, he hath muttered, or murmured, and is
taken generally for any kind of murmuring for any cause whatsoever,
as in this place, <em>But when David saw that his servants whispered</em>.
And again, <em>All that hate me, whisper together against me</em>.
And in another place: <i><span lang="la">Fuderunt submissam orationem</span></i>, a low whispering
prayer. In which places it is taken for any kind of low speaking,
whispering or muttering. Of this we may observe these things.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Sometimes by a Metonymie it is taken for a low and modest
speech, the art of Oratory, or Eloquence, as <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i> 3. 3. <i><span lang="la">&#38; intelligentem
vel peritum eloquentiæ</span></i>, and sometime for an ear-ring <em>inauris</em>,
as in the 20. verse of the same Chapter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Psal. 58. 6.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. It is also ascribed unto Charmers or Inchanters as in the Psalm,
<em>That doth not hearken unto the voice of the charmers</em>: Where it is
plain that all Charmers were whisperers and mutterers, but not on
the contrary, that all whisperers or mutterers are Charmers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Eccles. 10. 11.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. And whereas our English translation readeth it, <em>Surely the
serpent will bite without inchantment, and a babler is no better</em>; It
may as well be read, as <em>Arias Montanus</em> translates it, <i><span lang="la">Si mordeat
serpens in non susurro, vel absq: susurro</span></i>, If the Serpent bite without
hissing, or sibilation. And <em>Schindlerus</em> to the same purpose:
<i><span lang="la">Si mordebit serpens absq; incantatione, vel murmure, id est sibilo</span></i>.
And so <em>Avenarius</em>: <i><span lang="la">Si mordeat serpens absq; susurratione, id est absq;
sibilo</span></i>. And though <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i>, and the whole troop of Translators
do render it, as our English Translators do, yet that will not make
sense: for it would inferr that as a Serpent will bite except it be
charmed, so will a babler do also. But who ever heard of a bablers
being charmed? So that truly considered that cannot be the sense of
the place.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>But if it be taken exactly according to the Hebrew, then the sense
runs thus, If the Serpent bite without, or in not hissing, and excellency
is not to him that hath a tongue; that is, The Serpent
doth hurt with his biting, without making a noise with his tongue;
but a babler doth make a noise, but effecteth nothing, or speaketh
to no purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jerem. 8. 17.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. There is another Text in <em>Jeremy</em> which is commonly rendered
thus: <em>For behold I will send serpents, cockatrices among you,
which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord</em>.
But it may be as fitly read, To whom there is no hissing, and they
shall bite you. And whether way soever it be read, the sense is
good; that is, their enemies shall be so fierce and cruel, that no
words can stay or appease their fury; or that they shall be so sly and
cunning, that they shall destroy you, before they speak, or give
you warning: And whether way soever it be, there is a pronoun
in the Hebrew which is superfluous, a thing that is usual in that
language.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. But if in both places it be taken for charming, yet will it not
prove the being and existence of such a kind of Witch, as we have
denied and confuted; nor doth it shew any fit appellation for such
a one.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Psal. 104. 4.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Malach. 4. 1.</div>

<p class='c008'>12. Moreover there is another word as much mistaken, and as
falsly translated as any of the rest, and that is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>לָהַט</span>, <i><span lang="la">Inflammatus
est, flammescebat</span></i>, and is understood a shining brightness, as in the
Psalm: <em>Who maketh his Angels spirits: his ministers flaming fire</em>.
And in another place, <i><span lang="la">&#38; inflammabit eos dies veniens</span></i>; The day
cometh that shall burn as an oven. From whence we may note these
things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 3. 24.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Nahum 3. 3.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. From this root doth come <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>לַהַט</span> <i><span lang="la">Flamma</span></i>, Metaphorically (as
<em>Schindlerus</em> saith) a polished and shining piece of Metal, as a
Sword or the like. But <em>Avenarius</em> tells us, it is, <i><span lang="la">Flamma rutilans,
lamina fulgens &#38; vibrans</span></i>; as, <em>And he placed at the East of the garden
of Eden, Cherubims, and a flaming or bright shining sword
which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life</em>. And in another
place, <em>The horseman lifteth up the bright sword, and the
glittering spear</em>. Both places plainly shewing that it signifieth Metal
so polished, that when it is shaken in the light, or shining of the
Sun, and moved quickly, it doth then glitter like a red and shining
flame.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. There is also the word <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>לאט</span> <i><span lang="la">Involvit, velavit, arcanum</span></i>, and
the like which the vulgar Latin do attribute to <em>Pharaohs</em> Magicians,
when our translation saith, <em>And they did in like manner with
their inchantments</em>: It is <i><span lang="la">&#38; fecerunt similiter per sua arcana</span></i>, thinking
the word there had been derived from <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>לאט</span> <em>arcanum</em>, when it is
from <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>לַהַט</span>, <i><span lang="la">Flamma, lamina</span></i>; a polisht and bright piece of Metal.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. In all the places of Exodus where mention is made of the Magicians,
<em>that they did in like manner with their inchantments</em>, the word
is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>בְּלַהֲטֵיהֶם</span> which if truly rendered, is this: And they did in like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>manner with their bright, glittering lamens, or plates of Metal.
And how the Translators could hale it by head and shoulder
to signifie Inchantment, cannot be conjectured; but because the
Magicians are there called, <i><span lang="la">sapientes &#38; præstigiatores</span></i>, Wise Men
and Juglers, they vainly thought that they wrought by a secret
compact with the Devil, and so all must be done by their imaginary
Witchcraft and inchantment, when it is plain that what they
did was by natural Magick, and sleight of hand, and not by Diabolical
Magick at all. But let them shew us any one place in all the
Old Testament, where any of the derivatives from this root, are
translated Inchantments, but only in these places of <em>Exodus</em>, and we
will yield the whole cause.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 19. 3.</div>

<p class='c008'>13. There is also another Text which we have omitted of purpose
until now, which our English Translators do, according to
their usual manner, thus render: <em>And they shall seek to the Idols,
and to the Charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the
Wizards</em>: In which there is a word not used in that sense in all the
Old Testament besides; of which place we may note these things.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The word there in doubt is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>אָט</span>, <i><span lang="la">Lenis, lenitas</span></i>, and it oft becometh
an Adverb, <i><span lang="la">leniter, pedetentim</span></i>. The root <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>אָטַט</span>, <i><span lang="la">leniter incessit</span></i>,
<em>Avenarius</em> saith it is not used in the plural number, and signifieth
Inchanters or Diviners, and is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>הָאִטִּים</span><a id='t135'></a> which he rendereth <em>Incantatores</em>;
because as some think they do easily and gentilely pronounce
their charms.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. But <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> doth translate it thus: <i><span lang="la">Consulent sua Idola, &#38;
præstigiatores Pythonesq; &#38; ariolos</span></i>: And giveth this note, Their
Idols, that is to say Devils, that give them answers, especially the
Idol of <em>Latona</em> in the Town called <em>Butun</em> over against the Sebenitick
mouth of <em>Nilus</em>, of which <em>Herodotus</em> speaketh: where he expoundeth
also divers consultations of these Idols. But how or in
what sense he holdeth that the Devils gave answers, except by the
lying Impostures of the Priests, he doth not shew, nor <em>Herodotus</em>
his Author neither.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. But this place according to <em>Arias Montanus</em> is rendered thus:
And they shall seek unto their vain things or Idols, and to their Diviners
(that is this word <em>Haattim</em>) and to the Pythonists, or Oraclers,
and to Wizards. But those we call the Septuagint do render
this place very odly, as they seldom do elsewhere, which is this:
<span lang="grc">Καὶ ἐπερωτήσουσι τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτων, καὶ τὰ ἀγάλματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς γῆς φωνοῦντας, καὶ
τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους</span>, that is, <em>And they shall ask their gods, and their images, or painted statues, and those that give their voice forth of the earth, and those that speak in their breasts or bellies</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Strab. Geograph.</em> <em>l.</em> 16.</div>

<p class='c008'>14. There is also another word which is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>אַשָּׁף</span>, and signifieth (as
<em>Avenarius</em> saith) <i><span lang="la">Sophus, sapiens in Astrologia &#38; in auspiciis, augur,
aruspex</span></i>. <em>Rabbi Abraham</em> thinketh it signifieth a Physician,
who knoweth the alteration of the body, by the pulse of the
arm, or by the urine. And <em>Schindlerus</em> translateth it, a Philosopher,
an Astronomer and a Physician, and saith that such were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Astronomers and Physicians amongst the <em>Chaldeans</em>, of whom <em>Strabo</em>
saith: “There was a certain habitation appointed in <em>Babylon</em> for
their home-bred Philosophers, who were much conversant about
Philosophy, and were called <em>Chaldeans</em>.” And further, “that
they were Physicians that could judge of the passions of the Body,
which dreams did imitate, by the Pulse and urine.” And <em>Polanus</em>
tells us that it is a <em>Chaldee</em> word because it is found no where else
but in <em>Daniel</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Kings 4. 30.</div>

<p class='c008'>15. Lastly there is one word we shall touch more, and that is
<span lang='he' dir='rtl'>חָכְמָה</span>,<a id='t136'></a> <i><span lang="la">sapientia</span></i>, the wisdom of Divine and Humane things, Magick
or skil in naturall things; and cometh from the root <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>חָכַם</span>,
<i><span lang="la">sapuit mente, sapiens fuit, sapientia præditus est</span></i>. And this is that
wisdom that is ascribed to Solomon, of whom it is said: <em>And Solomons
wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East countrey,
and all the wisdom of Ægypt</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>So have we run over all the words in the Old Testament, that
can any way concern this subject, and yet amongst them all there is
not one that properly and genuinely, without stretching, wresting
or mistranslating, doth, or can signifie any such Witch or Diviner,
that can kill or destroy Men or Beasts, or that maketh a visible
compact with a Devil, or on whose Body he sucketh, or that they
have Carnal Copulation together; or such a Witch as is or can be
really changed into a Cat, Dog, or such like, which was the task we
undertook in this Chapter. And for the words that are in the New
Testament, we shall handle them when we answer the objections
made from thence. And therefore we would admonish Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>,
and all other candid, and sober persons to beware of false or mistranslations,
and not to labour to establish dangerous and erroneous
tenents upon such slippery and sandy foundations: For one falsity
once supposed or taken for good, doth bring a numerous
train of absurdities at the heels of it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAP. VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'><em>Of divers places in the Old Testament that are commonly
wrested, and falsly expounded, thereby to prove apparitions,
and the power of the Devil and Witches.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Thus far we conceive that we have sufficiently proved, that
there is no word in the Old Testament, that in the original
Hebrew, can genuinely and truly be translated, that doth signifie
such a kind of Witch, whose existence we have denied. And now
we shall proceed to answer those places in the Old Testament,
that commonly are produced, to prove the Devils or the Witches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>power in those particulars that we have oppugned. And because
the whole stress lyeth upon the true interpretation of those places
pretended to prove such matters by, we think it convenient and
much conducible to the business in hand, to lay down those rules
of interpretation, that the most learned Divines have declared and
assigned; and that in these particulars.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>James 1. 5, 17.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 24. 45.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. That truly to understand the Scriptures according to the
mind of the Holy Ghost that gave them forth, and by whose inspiration
they were indited, it is most necessary that we implore
the help of that blessed Spirit, that did reveal them to those that penned
them; because, as S. <em>James</em> saith: <em>If any of you lack wisdom, let him
ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not,
and it shall be given him. For every good gift, and every perfect gift
is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights, with whom
if no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</em> And it is said of the
Disciples of Christ: <em>Then opened he their understandings, that they
might understand the Scriptures</em>. So that all Men whether wise or unwise,
learned or unlearned, have need of the teaching and spirit
of Christ to open their understandings to understand the Scriptures;
and therefore have all men need of faithful and fervent Prayers,
that God may enlighten their minds in the understanding of them;
otherwayes, they are but as blind Men, that go without a guide,
and so must needs fall into the Ditch of ignorance and error.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. That a most due and diligent collation and comparison be
made of the several versions, with the Fountains and Originals
themselves, that so the truth of the translations may be ascertained.
For if an error in this point be committed, all the expositions and
deductions drawn from thence, must needs be erroneous and vitious.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. That there be a due comparing of the Antecedents and Consequents
in the context, that the purpose, scope, theme, arguments,
disposition and method, may be perfectly and maturely considered:
otherwise the sleighting or omitting any one of these particular
points, the whole place may be mistaken, and an error easily
faln into.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. There must a due and serious consideration be had of the
Phrases and manner of speaking; especially in regard of that language
it was first written in: For every several language hath its
peculiar Phrases and forms of speaking, which may not be proper
in another tongue, the not regarding of which may sooner lead into
a great deviation from the genuine sense of the place.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. That there be a most diligent comparing of the place of the
Scripture to be explicated, with others of the same similitude or
dissimilitude, For oftentimes one Scripture doth unfold and open
another, and one Text doth enucleate and make plain another:
Which for want of a due comparison one with another, may occasion
the mistaking of the true sense of the place that is to be
expounded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>6. And chiefly in explicating any place, regard must be had to
the Analogy of faith: Because the Scriptures do not contradict one
another, especially in the Articles of faith, and the chief points
necessary to be believed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Pet. 1. 20.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 8. 7.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 29. 14.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 1. 19, 20.</div>

<p class='c008'>7. There ought a due comparison be made with the judgments
and sentiments of other Interpreters, according as the Apostle saith:
<em>That no Prophecie of Scripture is of any private interpretation</em>: Which
ought to be rendered as learned <em>Beza</em> and Dr. <em>Hammond</em> give it:
“No Prophecie of Scripture is <i><span lang="la">propriæ incitationis</span></i>, of a Mans own
or proper incitation, motion, or loosing forth;” for so the Greek is,
<span lang="grc">ἰδίας ἐπιλύσεως οὐ γίνεται</span>. Of which <em>Beza</em> gives this learned note. “The
Prophets truly are to be read, but so that the gift of interpretation
be begged of God, that the same God may be the Author
and Interpreter of the Prophetical writings.” For though a
Man have by nature never so great endowments, of understanding,
judgment and reason, or have never so large and ample acquirements,
or presume never so highly to be assisted with the Spirit;
yet his own single judgment ought not to be relyed upon in the
exposition of the Scriptures; but he ought to call in to his aid, and
to consider the sentiment and opinion of others. For it is obvious
into what dangerous errors the <em>Arrians</em>, <em>Pelagians</em> and <em>Antitrinitarians</em>
of old, and the <em>Socinians</em> and <em>Arminians</em> of later
years have faln, by making their innate notions and the strength
of natural reason to be the chief and principal rules for interpreting
of the Scriptures by. And there is hardly any one thing that the
Scriptures are more against, or do more condemn, than the too
much extolling and idolizing of Humane and Carnal reason. <em>Because
the carnal mind</em> <span lang="grc">τὸ φρόνημα τῆς σαρκὸς</span>, <em>is enmity against God, and
is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be</em>; of which <em>Beza</em>
saith: <i><span lang="la">Probatio cur intelligentia carnis sit mors, quia, inquit, Dei
est hostis</span></i>. And again, the Text saith: <em>For it is written, I will destroy
the wisdom of the wise</em>, <span lang="grc">τὴν σοφίαν τών σοφῶν</span>, <em>and will bring to nothing
the understanding of the prudent</em>; <span lang="grc">τὴν σύνεσιν των συνετων</span>. And again,
<em>Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</em> <span lang="grc">σοφίαν τοῦ
κόσμου τούτου</span>. And the words of the Hebrew in that place of <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i>
do signifie all that height of wisdom or understanding, that Men
either have by Nature, or acquire by Art and Industry. Neither
is it safe for a Man to rely upon his own single acquired parts, be
they never so vast or great; because in the most ages, the most
pestilent Errors and damnable Heresies have been vented and maintained
by Men that were of the greatest acquired endowments.
And that it is often as vain to presume upon having the guidance
of the Spirit, as are the other two, is manifest in the late times of
Rebellion and Confusion; where every Man pretending the Spirit,
made such wild and extravagant expositions of the Scriptures, as
few ages have known before; and is still kept up by the giddy
troop of Fanatical Quakers, and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is another rule which the learned do use, in expounding of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the Scriptures, which is often either too far extended, or not rightly
limited and applied, which is this; That Men in interpreting
of the Scriptures should keep close to the literal sense, if it include
not an absolute absurdity. Whereby Allegorical, Metaphorical,
Mystical and Parabolical Expositions are not only cried down,
but by some even abhorred and detested, which thing ought not
absolutely and simply to be approved of; and therefore we shall
make it plain in some few particulars.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>John 9. 6, 7.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. In Historical relations of matters of fact, we ought to keep
close to the literal meaning, and not to deviate a jot from it, otherwise
we should overthrow the best part of the Christian Faith,
and destroy the chief foundation of Scripture truths. But notwithstanding
this, though we ought to hold to the literal sense in respect
of the matter of fact, yet we are not always to be bound to
the bare letter in the mood, means or manner of the performance.
As may be plain in these examples. 1. It is apparent that our Saviour
Christ cured the Man that was born blind, and the means
and manner is described: <em>He spat on the ground and made clay of
the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.
And said unto him, Go wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation,
Sent.) He went his way therefore and washed, and
came seeing.</em> Now as to the matter of fact, that the Man born blind
was cured and had his sight restored, is a truth according to the
sense of the letter; and that the manner, which was by spittle and
earth made into Clay, and his eyes covered or anointed with it,
and washing in the pool of <em>Siloam</em>, was also literally true, is manifest.
But it were absurd so far to stick to the letter, as to believe that
clay, and spittle, and washing in the poole <em>Siloam</em>, were true and
real natural means to produce that effect; no, that were absurd, and
therein the literal sense is not to be followed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Kings 22. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Jerem. 23. 24.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Kings 8. 27.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 16. 27.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Again concerning <em>Ahab</em>, thus much is literally true in matter
of fact that he was perswaded to go up to <em>Ramoth Gilead</em>
by his false Prophets in whose mouths there was a lying Spirit.
But the manner there declared of sending the lying Spirit into
their Mouths, cannot rationally be presumed to be true in a
literal sense, but in a Metaphorical; for that the Lord was set on
his Throne, and all the Host of Heaven standing by him, on the
right hand and on the left, must needs be a Metaphor taken from
an Emperour or a King that sits on his Throne, and all his Counsellors,
Princes, Estates and Officers about him, to deliberate and
consult what is to be done. And this is the highest and most
apt Metaphor that the supream Majesty of Heaven and Earth can
be represented by; not that in the literal sense it must be believed
to be acted just in that mood and manner, but as the most apposite
Metaphor that can be found to express the proceedings of
the Heavenly Majesty by, and that for these reasons. 1. God is
Infinite and is every where by his Power, Essence and Presence,
and therefore cannot literally be said to be comprehended in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>locality, but after a Metaphorical sense and expression. For the
Prophet saith: <em>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, saith the Lord?</em>
And as <em>Solomon</em> confesseth: <em>But will God indeed dwell upon the
earth? Behold, the heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot contain
thee: how much less this house that I have builded?</em> 2. God who is only
wise, and before whose eyes <em>all things lie open, and naked</em>, cannot litterally
be said to consult or deliberate, or to ask his creatures how
a thing shall be done or brought to pass, because his wisdom is,
like himself, Infinite, and need ask counsel of none, and therefore
must the manner of the performance of the deceiving of <em>Ahabs</em> Prophets
needs be Metaphorically understood, and not literally, which
is the thing that we would demonstrate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 John 1. 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Tim. 6. 16.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. Further concerning Satans afflicting of <em>Job</em> in his Goods, Cattels,
Children, Servants, and in his own Body, is a real truth literally
so taken as to the matter of fact; but the manner of Satans
appearing before God, with the Sons of God, cannot without manifest
absurdity be understood in a literal sense but in a Metaphorical,
that God who is Omnipotent, did command, order, send
and limit him, what and how far he was to act. For otherwise <em>God
is light in whom there is no darkness at all, dwelling in the light
which no Man can approach unto</em>; but Satan is bound <i><span lang="la">in chains of
everlasting darkness</span></i>, and therefore cannot be said literally to appear
in person before God, but by way of a Metaphor. So when
the Angel telleth the Virgin <em>Mary</em>, that the should conceive in her
womb, and she not understanding how that should come to pass,
because she had not known Man, the Angel answered, <em>the Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow
thee</em>. Though the matter of fact be an undoubted truth,
and an Article of faith, literally so taken; yet the manner of the
Holy Ghosts coming upon her, and the power of the highest overshadowing
her, cannot be understood in a literal sense, as though
it were by that natural and humane way that Men and Women do
beget and conceive Children by, for that were horrid and absurd
(as some late prophane, wretched and debauched Atheists have
spattered forth) but after a Metaphorical sense, and a most mystical
meaning. So that it is plain that where a matter of fact may be literally
and Historically true, yet the manner how that matter of
fact is brought to pass may be, nay must be Metaphorical, or else
an absurdity will follow, which was the thing undertaken to be
proved.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. There is nothing more common and usual in Scripture than Metaphors,
as when Christ saith, <em>I am a vine, I am the door of the sheep,
I am the living bread that came down from heaven</em>: Though they
be Metaphors, yet the things signified and intended by them are as
really and certainly true, as are the Metaphors themselves, and
sometimes more true; because sometime the Metaphor is not used
for the verity of its existence, but according to the common use
and opinion, as <em>O foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you?</em> doth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>intend no more but an allusion to vulgar opinion, that held that
men might be bewitched and inchanted. And so Christ in the true
mystical and spiritual meaning is as really a spiritual vine, door and
bread, as there are any of such things in nature, or being. But as
that which is Literally and Historically true in matter of fact, or
meaning, is not to be deceeded from; so that which is a Metaphor
ought not to be turned into a literal thing, nor on the contrary,
the literal sense ought not to be made Metaphorical.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 7. 24, 25, 26, 27.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. Parables are Similitudes taken from things that may have been
done, or that are supposed to have been done, and so the thing to
which the comparison is made, or from whence the Similitude is
taken, need not always be a thing that hath been performed in all
the circumstances and manner thereof; it is sufficient that the thing
was possible, or rationally probable to have been acted, or at least
supposed so to have been. As for instance in that Parable, where
our Saviour saith: <em>That those that hear his words and do them are
like a wise man that built his house upon a rock; and he that heareth
them, and doth them not, is like a foolish man, that built his house
upon the sand</em>: now it is not necessary that there should be two
such men, that in matter of fact did after that manner (though there
might have been many men before the time of our Saviour that
might have done so) but it was sufficient that the thing from which
the comparison was made, was possible, rational and probable.
But the thing intended by the Parable or Similitude, is alwayes a
spiritual truth and certainty. Concerning which learned <em>Beza</em> upon
the Parable of the Rich Man and <em>Lazarus</em> doth give us this remarkable
Marginal note: “Although Christ doth relate an History, notwithstanding
he writeth spiritual things under Figures, which he
knew were suitable to our sense. For neither are Souls endowed
with Fingers and Eyes, neither do they suffer thirst, neither have
they mutual conference one with another. Therefore the sum is,
that faithful Souls after they be departed from their Bodies, do
lead a pleasant and blessed life without the World: And that most
horrible torments are prepared for the reprobates, which can no
more be conceived by our minds, than the immense Glory of
Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c008'>6. As for an Allegory, which is a continuation of a Metaphor,
and properly signifies a figure expressing one thing by another, from
<span lang="grc">ἄλλος</span>, and <span lang="grc">ἀγορέω</span>, <em>enuntio</em>, and this is very frequently used in the
Scriptures, as when the Apostle speaking of the two Sons of <em>Abraham</em>,
<em>the one from Hagar a bond-woman, the other from Sarah a free woman</em>,
saith: <em>These things are an Allegorie</em>, <span lang="grc">ἅτενα ἀλληγορόυμενα</span>, which things do
express one thing by another; From whence we may note, 1. That
Allegories that tend to edification, keeping the Analogie of Faith,
and not perverting or overthrowing the literal sense, ought not to
be so much cried down nor condemned, as some have done both
against <em>Origen</em> and others. “For the Apostle here, as <em>Beza</em> hath noted,
made it manifest, that he had followed the footsteps of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Prophet <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i>, who did foretel that the Church was to be constituted
of the Children of Sarah that was barren, that is to say
of those who meerly and spiritually were by Faith to be made
the Sons of <em>Abraham</em>, rather than of <em>Hagar</em> that was fruitful,
even then foretelling the rejection of the Jews, and the vocation
of the Gentiles.” 2. Allegories may be used, and the literal sense
nevertheless preserved also for the History is literally true that <em>Sarah</em>
and <em>Hagar</em> were two living Women, the one <em>Abrahams</em> Wife a free
Woman, the other his Servant, and a bond-woman, and yet this
did not hinder but that thereby an Allegory might be used, and
they might, and did signifie and express another thing than what
was meerly contained in the letter. 3. We cannot here but add
the grave and learned opinion of S. <em>Augustin</em> upon this very point,
who rejecting the tenent of some that made Paradise and the things
therein contained, meerly corporal, and of some that made it only
spiritual and intelligible, doth run a middle course betwixt these
two extreams, saying thus: “As though Paradise could not be corporal,
because also it might be understood to be spiritual: As
though therefore there were not two Women <em>Agar</em> and <em>Sarah</em>,
and of them two Sons of <em>Abraham</em>, one of the bond-woman, the
other of the free woman, because the Apostle saith that the two
Testaments were prefigured in them; or therefore that water had
flowed from no rock <em>Moses</em> smiting, because there by a figurative
signification Christ also may be understood, the Apostle saying,
<em>and the rock was Christ</em>.” And after concludeth thus: “These
and some others may be spoken of understanding Paradise spiritually,
and may be spoken without contradiction, while notwithstanding
the most faithful verity of that History may be believed
in the commendable narration of the things done or performed.”
This same opinion this learned Father doth maintain in another
place, where he is speaking of the Ark of <em>Noah</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having premised these rules for the right expounding of the
Scriptures, we shall now come to the main things that we purpose
to handle in this Chapter. And those that would uphold a kind of
omnipotency in Devils, and maintain their great power in Elementary
and Sublunary things, the better to defend the great power
of Witches, do alledge divers places of Scripture, and expound
them in favour of their gross tenents, which now we shall examine
and confute in order as they lie.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The first colourable argument that they produce, is from the
Devils or the Serpents tempting and seducing of <em>Eve</em>, where labouring
to prove the Devils power, and his visible apparition to Witches,
and making a compact with them, they pretend that in the seducing
of <em>Eve</em> he did visibly appear unto her and vocally discourse
with her, and to that purpose that he essentially entred into the
Body of the Serpent, and spoke through its Organs, or that he
assumed the visible and corporeal shape of a Serpent, and so discoursed,
and had collocution with her. To answer which (that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>we may proceed methodically,) we shall lay down and labour to
prove these two positions. 1. That if it were granted that he did
it either way, it would be no advantage, thereby to prove the ordinary
power of Devils or Witches.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. That that place of Scripture, if rightly weighed and considered,
will no way make it rationally appear, that the Devil performed that
temptation any other way but only mentally; and that the History
there in the manner and circumstances of it, is only to be Allegorically
and Metaphorically expounded. And as to the first, if it were
granted it proves nothing to the purpose, for the power of Devils
or Witches, as these two Arguments will sufficiently evince.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. From no single instance or particular proposition, can ever a
general conclusion be rightly drawn by any known and certain
rules of Reason or Logick; for <i><span lang="la">Syllogizari non est ex particulari</span></i>,
is known to any Tyronist in that Art. But if Satan for that once
should have entred into the natural Serpent, or assumed his shape,
it is a deceivable and vitious way of arguing, that therefore he hath
such a power over all Bodies at all times when he pleaseth, or that
he can assume what shape he please, and therefore it certainly and
rationally concludeth nothing of validity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 10. 13.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. In the temptation of <em>Eve</em>, there was something more extraordinary
than can be assigned in any other temptation whatsoever, except
that of Christ. And therefore was there a more peculiar and
extraordinary dispensation from God in that case than can be shewed
in any others but that of Christ. For now it pleaseth God in
his merciful providence, so to order and overrule the malice of his
hellish will, and to restrain and bridle his envious nature, that
though his will be never so wicked, yet is he kept in his chains of
darkness, <em>and God will not suffer his people to be tempted, above
what they are able, but will with the temptation also make way to
escape that they may be able to bear it</em>. Now <em>Adam</em> and <em>Eve</em> were
in an extraordinary condition in respect of the Saints of God in this
life, or of any other persons, and there was a more high and greater
end in the providence of God in ordering and permitting of that
temptation than there is or can be in any others, but that of Christ:
And therefore from what the Lord permitted, and ordered to do
in that temptation, or the liberty that he might grant him to exert
his own power then, will no argument rationally follow that he
can commonly and at his pleasure perform as much, and so maketh
no firm conclusion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Pererii Comment. in locum.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>And as concerning that place of Scripture in the third of <em>Genesis</em>
the great and learned Jesuit <em>Pererius</em> doth undertake with tooth
and nail to prove that it is to be literally interpreted, and that Satan
did really enter into the Body of the natural Serpent, and spoke
in him, or through his Organs; and laboureth (though in vain) to
enervate and overthrow the strong arguments of his Brother in Religion,
the most learned Cardinal <em>Cajetan</em>, Where he rejecteth the
opinion of those that hold that the Devil did assume a Body in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the shape of a Serpent; because (he saith) that Satan presently after
the temptation ended must have deposited and put off the assumed
body, but that the Serpent was after in Paradise, and therefore
that he did not act it in an assumed Body. Therefore we shall also
pass by that opinion of assuming of Bodies, as being a meer groundless
figment invented by the dreaming Schoolmen, as we shall demonstrate
hereafter. But to proceed in order, We shall first shew
that the place must of necessity admit of an Allegory or Metaphor.
And secondly, we shall lay down positive Arguments to
shew the absurdity and impossibility of the Devils speaking in the
Serpent, or by his Organs. And thirdly, we shall answer all objections
that are material, and that in these particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The thing that in that History is to be taken literally, is that
<em>Eve</em> was tempted and seduced; but the instrument by which it was
done, the manner and circumstances, must of necessity have an Allegorical
or Metaphorical interpretation, otherwise no sense rationally
can be made of the place at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Dialog.</em> Discourses of Spirits and Devils. <em>Dialog.</em> 4. <em>p.</em> 110.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. “There can no blame of the action be imputed to Satan himself,
if neither absolutely, nor properly, nor Historically, nor
Allegorically, nor Metaphorically, nor no ways else he be named
in that very History of <em>Evahs</em> tentation, wherein the action it self
with the several circumstances is fully and plainly expressed. For
the action especially being so weighty a matter, was necessary to
be known in every point: And therefore it is not to be doubted,
but that the History concerning the same is so exactly set forth,
with every circumstance, as that any Man may be able to judge of
the principal Actors therein at the least. So then, although the
Devil in that History, be neither absolutely, nor Historically,
nor properly expressed by name; yet must we acknowledge him
to be therein Allegorically and Metaphorically set forth at the
least, or otherways impose no blame upon him at all concerning
the action.” And therefore must <em>Pererius</em> needs confess a Metaphor
in the place, or else the Devil cannot be made an actor in the business.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. It was no natural Serpent but the Devil himself Metaphorically
set forth by the name of a Serpent, who gave the onset upon
<em>Evah</em> in that tentation. For by Allegories and Metaphors there is evermore
some other thing meant than that which is literally expressed.
And that this is so, is thus proved. If in that action the Devil himself
be not Historically and properly, but Allegorically and Metaphorically,
called a Serpent, because he is most crafty and subtile;
then undoubtedly the objection of a natural Serpent to be used in
that action is very inconvenient: But the antecedent is true, and
therefore also the consequent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Apoc. 12. 3, 4, 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Id.</em> 20. 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. The antecedent to that Hypothetical Argument foregoing is
easily thus proved: It is an accustomed thing in the Sacred Scriptures
to use the names of other creatures in setting forth to our
sense the Intellectual Creatures themselves. Hereupon it is that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the <em>Apocalypse</em> the Devil (by a perpetual Allegory) is called a Dragon
or Serpent: And therefore in this History of <em>Evahs</em> tentation,
by the like perpetual Allegory he is also called a Serpent. For no
Man can be so absurd and foolish to think that the Devil literally
and properly (in that of the Revelation) can be called a Dragon
or Serpent; but only in a Metaphorical and Mystical sense, and
therefore must in right reason be taken so in that place of <em>Genesis</em>;
for one part of Scripture is alwaies best interpreted by another.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 49. 9.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Revel. 5. 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 3. 7.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. Again how can <em>Judah</em> literally <em>be a lions whelp</em>, or Christ
<em>called the lion of the tribe of Judah</em>? must it needs be understood
that Christ either assumed the shape of a natural Lion, or that he
entred into the Body of a natural Lion? Surely not, that were
most absurd to think or believe. Even so must it be accounted
most absurd and abominable for <em>Pererius</em>, or any other to fancy
that the Devil may not properly enough in an Allegory, or Mystical
sense be called a Serpent in that action of tempting of <em>Evah</em>,
without either assuming the shape of a Serpent, or entring into the
Body of a natural one. I appeal to all rational Men to judge if the
absurdities of both be not alike, if barely and literally taken. But
this being one of <em>Cajetans</em> Arguments, was too hard a morsel for
the teeth of <em>Pererius</em>; and therefore he past it over without an
answer. Further when our Saviour called the Pharisees, and Sadducees
<em>a generation of vipers</em>, must any Man be so extreamly mad
as to believe that naturally and literally they were generated by
vipers? Must it not be understood that they were called so from
their poysonous and wicked minds, by way of Metaphor? Yes
surely: and so is the Devil called a Serpent by a Metaphor, or else
literally so taken, both appellations are equally absurd. And let <em>Pererius</em>
or any other unloose this knot.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>John 8. 44.</div>

<p class='c008'>6. How can the Devil be a very <em>murtherer from the beginning</em>,
(which he is Mystically so considered) if he had no hand in the destroying
of <em>Evah</em> and <em>Adam</em> both in Souls and Bodies? But if by
the Serpent the Devil was not understood, then he stands acquitted,
and was not guilty of the murdering <em>Adam</em> and <em>Evah</em> both in
Souls and Bodies. But we must affirm that all learned and rational
Divines, whether antient, middle or modern, that have expounded
or commented upon that place, do by the words of our Saviour
<em>calling Satan a murderer from the beginning</em>, understand the murdering
of <em>Adam</em> and <em>Evah</em> both in Souls and Bodies; And we dare
referr all those that have taken, or will take pains to examine
them upon that piece of Scripture, that they shall be found as we
have averred.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Cor. 11. 3.</div>

<p class='c008'>7. <em>Moses</em> (in that action) doth purposely intitle the Devil by
the name of a Serpent, because (by his effectual creeping into the
interiour senses, as also by infecting Mens minds with venomous
perswasions) he doth very lively represent the nature, disposition
and qualities of the venemous Serpent. And in this same sense was
the Apostle jealous over the <em>Corinthians</em>, left as <em>that Serpent</em> <span lang="grc">ὁ ὄφις</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>(which must necessarily be understood of Satan by a Metaphor of
that Serpent) <em>beguiled Evah through his subtilty</em>, so they might by
the cunning of Satan in his false Apostles <em>have their minds corrupted
from the simplicity that is in Christ</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. The Serpent that tempted <em>Evah</em> in Paradise, is there said to
be <em>more subtile than every beast of the field</em>, the which (if the writing
of such as have observed and described the nature of all sorts of
animals be true) cannot be avouched truly of the natural Serpent.
For there are many other creatures more subtil than the Serpent.
And therefore it must needs be understood of the spiritual Serpent,
that is, Satan who is (indeed) the old Serpent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Judg. 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c008'>9. <em>Moses</em> doth therefore purposely attribute speech to the Serpent
which tempted <em>Evah</em>, to the end we (knowing by experience that
speech cannot properly accord with a natural Serpent) might the
rather be induced to believe that the same must metaphorically be
understood of the spiritual Serpent. For we may with like absurdity
imagine that <em>the olive, the fig, the Vine-trees and the Bramble</em>
did vocally and articulately speak one to another; as to suppose
that either the Serpent, or the Devil in the Serpent did use an articulate
voice and discourse unto <em>Evah</em>; they are both alike credible,
and both alike absurd.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. The punishment inflicted by God, hath no conveniency at
all with the natural, but with the spiritual and mystical Serpent,
which is the Devil. For neither can the going upon her belly, nor
the eating of dust be any punishment at all to the natural Serpent,
because (before the tentation) both those properties were peculiarly
allotted unto her, she taking her name from her creeping condition,
for <i><span lang="la">Serpens</span></i> is derived <i><span lang="la">à serpendo</span></i>, and in the Hebrew she is
called <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>רֶמֶשׂ</span><a id='t146'></a> <em>reptile à</em> <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>רָמַשׂ</span>, <i><span lang="la">reptavit, serpsit</span></i>. Neither yet may we imagine
that the said Serpent being of some better form before the tentation,
was then (by the just judgment of God) transformed into a viler
proportion, property or shape, she being in the History of the
Creation accompted amongst the creeping Creatures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Exod. 4. 3.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Aug. ad Gen.</em> <em>lib.</em> 11. <em>cap.</em> 1.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Greg. in Moràl.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Pet. Martyr in Gen. 3. 1.</div>

<p class='c008'>11. <em>Moses</em> maketh no mention at all of the Serpents coming
to <em>Evah</em> about that business, nor of her departure after the action,
nor of any one special property whereby she might be essentially
discerned to be (indeed) a true natural Serpent, nor of any manner
of amaze, or suddain fear in <em>Evah</em> at her suddain approach and extraordinary
speech: whereas yet <em>Moses</em> himself was afterwards horribly
afraid at the only sight of a Serpent. And where it is said,
<em>Thou art cursed above all the beasts in the field</em>; there the very
bruit beasts (to the horrible confusion of Satan) are preferred before
him; not in absolute power, but in an especial regard of that
happy continuance and timely conservation of their original nature.
For, the beasts of the field, they do not forgo any heavenly happiness,
which they never yet had: But they continue forth their
course in that self same primary estate they took at the first.
But Satan is accursed because he kept not his first estate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>but fell from it, and therefore is worse than the beasts of the field.
Neither is this way of expounding the Scriptures metaphorically,
where the literal sense includeth an apparent absurdity, either singular
or novel, for both Antients and Moderns have allowed the
same course, for S. <em>Augustine</em> saith: “When any thing is found in
the Scriptures which cannot (without an absurdity) be possibly
interpreted literally, That thing without doubt is spoken figuratively,
and must receive some other signification, than the
bare letter doth seem to import.” And <em>Gregory</em> saith: “When the
order of the History becometh defective of it self in the literal
sense, then some mystical sense as it were with wide open doors
doth offer it self: yea and that mystical sense must be received instead
of the literal sense it self.” And therefore (saith <em>Peter Martyr</em>)
“that malediction or curse which the Lord did cast on the Serpent,
must be Allegorically understood of the Devil, and those
things which seem properly to accord to the Serpent indeed, must
metaphorically be transferred to Satan understood in the Serpent.”
So then, by all the premises it is very apparent, that it was the Devil
himself, and no natural Serpent, who set upon <em>Evah</em> in that tentation,
he being only metaphorically set forth by the name of a
Serpent: And therefore had no need in that action essentially to
assume to himself the Body of a natural Serpent, for the better accomplishment
of the intended business.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next is to lay down positive Arguments to prove that the
Devil did not essentially enter into the body of the Serpent and
if he did, that yet neither he by himself, nor the Serpent, and he
joyned, could thereby make any articulate sound or discourse. Which
if the Devil in the Serpent be supposed (as it is) to perform any
such matter, it must be either by considering him as an incorporeal
or as a corporeal creature, but we affirm he could perform neither
way, and that for these reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. If the Devil be considered as an incorporeal creature simply
and absolutely, then it will follow, that he cannot act upon any
corporeal matter, because an incorporeal substance can make no contact
upon a body, unless it were it self corporeal; for, <i><span lang="la">quicquid agit,
agit per contactum, vel mediatum, vel immediatum.</span></i> But both those
are caused by the touch of one body upon another, as when ones
hand by touching a straw doth immediately move it forth of its
place, or else by blowing doth remove it, which is by the mediation
of the air; but that which is meerly incorporeal can perform
neither: Because that which is meerly incorporeal hath no superficies,
whereby to touch the body to be removed; and therefore
can make no motion of it at all; and where there is no motion,
there can be no alteration, and consequently no speech nor articulation
at all. And therefore the Devil (if incorporeal) could not,
move the Organs of the Serpent at all, and so could not speak in
the Serpent nor move his organs, if they had been fit for articulate
prolation, which they were not. Which was the thing required to
be proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>2. The Serpent by the ordinance of God in the Creation was specificated
to an inarticulate sound, not to an articulate: but the
Devil neither hath, nor ever had any power to change and overturn
the course of Gods ordination in nature, and therefore hath not power,
nor never had to make the Serpent speak articulately; for that
were to overthrow the inviolable order of God set in the Creation,
which no man of sound judgment did ever aver that the Devil could
do.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. I take it to be one of the most firm maximes that ever the
Schools had, that, <i><span lang="la">immateriale non agit in materiale, nisi eminenter ut
Deus</span></i>: Therefore that the Devil being incorporeal and immaterial cannot
act upon that which is material, as was the body of the Serpent,
unless he had had a super-eminent and omnipotent power, which
were blasphemous to attribute unto him, therefore could he not
articulately speak in the Serpent unto <em>Evah</em>, because immaterial,
and had no omnipotent power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. And if he be conceived to be corporeal, then he could either
of himself speak articulately and audibly, or else not. And if
he could do so of himself, then to enter into the Serpent was needless
and superfluous. And if he could not, then the entring into the
Serpent would not have contributed that faculty unto him, and so
neither way he could have performed it; For a Frog creeping into
the body of a Man, will not cause the Frog to speak, though it may
make some noise or croaking.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. Though the Devil being corporeal should have entred into
the body of the Serpent, yet by no motion that could be made with
or upon her organs, could they have been framed to have uttered
an articulate sound, because they were not fitted for that purpose,
but only to have made a sibilation or hissing. For in Instruments
that are artificial, the several sounds and tunes made by them, are
but agreeable to the diversity of their parts and their several compactions;
so an Harp cannot (when made) be ordered to give forth
a sound like a Trumpet, nor the noise of a pair of Organs; nor on
the contrary: and if any of their parts be wanting, defective or
broken, then the orderly sound and Musick is spoyled. And though
a Parret or Paraquet may by vocal and external teaching be
brought to learn and speak some words; yet it is not by the teachers
entring into her belly, but by his outward, vocal teaching,
whereby her senses and phantasie are audibly wrought upon, and
not otherwise. But in this action ascribed unto Satan, he is not
supposed to be able to speak articulately, nor to have taught the
Serpent vocally and audibly, which if he could have done, yet
were not her organs capable of any such matter; and therefore it had
been more subtilty in the Devil rather to have chosen a Parret than
a serpent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only objection worth taking notice of that <em>Pererius</em> bringeth
against the sound and reasonable opinion of learned <em>Cajetan</em>, is this:
That <em>Adam</em> and <em>Evah</em> being in the state of innocency could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>wrought upon by an interiour tentation, because that neither the
sensitive appetite nor the phantasie were corrupted; and therefore
Satan could not internally work upon them, and therefore that
the whole tentation must be extrinsecal. To which we return this
sufficient reply.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. It is but a bare assertion without any proof at all, and he doth
but only shelter it under the authority of S. <em>Austin</em> and <em>Gregory</em>,
whose authority in many other matters he doth often reject when
they agree not with his humour, end and interest. But however
they are but <i><span lang="ca">testimonia humana</span></i>; and we are not to regard what
the Men are that do speak, so much as to consider the weight and
reason of what they do speak.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. He proceeds upon false supposition, that the sensitive appetite
and consequently the Phantasie could not be wrought upon nor
drawn, but by a sensible and exteriour object, when it is manifest
that the sight of the Serpent alone could not have stirred the
sensitive appetite; for it is rationally to be supposed as a certainty
that <em>Evah</em> had seen the Serpent before that time. Neither could it
be the discourse with the Serpent, barely considered as discourse,
that could have moved it; for it is certain she had heard, and had
had audible, vocal and articulate discourse with her Husband before
this time of the temptation. Neither could it be the beholding
of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for by the discourse
it appeareth that she had before seen it, and it is probable that the tentation
was in the view of it, and its species that appeared to her eye
of the said tree was the same that it was before. So that it will be as
most manifest that the tentation took effect from the strong lie that
Satan told her, <em>that their eyes should be opened and they should be as
Gods knowing good and evil</em>, and so her deception was first made
in her mind and understanding, and thereby the will was drawn,
and the sensitive appetite moved, whereupon <em>she took of the fruit
of the tree, and did eat.</em> And this may far more reasonably be
thought to be brought to pass by a mental discourse and internal motions,
than by external collocution, which must first work upon
the mind, before that the Phantasie or sensitive appetite could at
all be moved or drawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. If the tentation had been this way that <em>Pererius</em> supposeth it,
our first parents could not have been seduced; for Satans argument
lay not to perswade <em>Evah</em>, that it was pleasant for the taste or good
for the Stomach thereby to have drawn the sensitive appetite and
the Phantasie, but that it was good and profitable to make them
wise, <em>and to be like Gods</em>, whereby he insnared her understanding
with a fallacious and lying argument, thus framed, as learned
<i><span lang="la">Piscator</span></i> lays it down: “That thing which will bring you Divine
Wisdom and Felicity, that thing ye ought to make use of. But
the eating of this fruit can bring you Divine Wisdom and Felicity:
Therefore the eating of the fruit of this tree, ye ought to make
use of.” And so the seduction was not at all by the sensitive appetite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>(that could receive no more benefit by it than by the other
fruits in the Garden) but by her understanding being blinded with
a specious shew of an apparent (not a real) benefit, and thereby
her will drawn and led to put forth her hand, and to eat. And
therefore consequently there was no need at all of an extrinsecal
tentation, which might and was brought to pass by an intrinsick discourse,
working upon her understanding.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Surely if <em>Pererius</em> had been aware of the many inconveniences
that this opinion of his doth hurry along with it, he would never
have plunged himself into a Labyrinth of such perplexities;
some of which we shall here enumerate and so conclude. 1. If this
opinion were true, that <em>Evah</em> by reason of her perfection in the state
of innocency could not be tempted nor seduced, but only by an
external way and means: Then how could it come to pass that the
Angels in their Primitive Estate, which was as perfect (if not more)
than that of <em>Evahs</em>, were without a tempter or any external means
drawn unto that defection, who left their estate and station, and
abode not in the truth? 2. How could the defection have been
so general (for multitudes of them fell) if they had not had some
way or means to have communicated their cogitations and intentions
one to another? For though we are not able to apprehend
the manner how they discourse or commune one with another,
yet it must be taken for a truth that they have a way and means to
manifest their cogitations one to another, which is some way Analogous
to that which we call speech or discourse. Therefore concerning
this point doth learned and judicious <em>Zanchy</em> thus conclude.
“Therefore (he saith) that which we do by a sensible voice, the
same thing the Angels and blessed Souls in Heaven, yea the Devils
in the infernal pit, and in the air, do perform, but without
voice, in a spiritual manner.” 3. If this opinion were true, then
the blessed Souls, being divested from their Bodies, should not
have a communion one with another, nor should jointly praise and
glorifie God together, which were false and absurd; and therefore
the learned Father said well: “It is to be holden stedfastly that
the offices of the Heavenly Hoast are by no means performed in silence;
seeing, we may read that the Angelical powers before the
Throne of the Lord, do sound forth his praise with unwearied
voices.” 4. The sleights and subtil machinations (for he hath his
<span lang="grc">Νοήματα</span> or devices) of Satans Kingdom could not be carried on, if
he had not a way and means to communicate them to the rest of the
Crew of his inferiour Fiends, and therefore doth plainly prove
that there is a way of hidden, Mystical and Spiritual discourse,
which the Devil might, and did represent to the mind and understanding
of <em>Evah</em>, whereby she was seduced, and that there was no
need of a vocal and audible interlocution; and so much in answer
to his objection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next place of Scripture that is commonly brought and urged
thereby to prove the great power of Devils and Witches, is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of <em>Pharaohs</em> Magicians, from whence they argue thus: If the
Magicians of <em>Pharaoh</em> were able by the power and assistance of the
Devil to change their Rods into Serpents, the Water into Blood,
and to produce Frogs; Why may not Witches, by the power and
assistance of the Devil, change themselves and other things into
strange and several shapes, and do the rest of the feats that are ascribed
unto them?</p>

<p class='c008'>But though this be but <i><span lang="la">petitio principii</span></i>, a begging of the question,
that by the assistance of the Devil they did these things,
which is neither supposed nor granted, but ought first to have been
proved; And though in the case of hardening <em>Pharaohs</em> heart, there
might be (and was) a peculiar dispensation from God at that time:
yet it will not follow that God doth always dispense with, and
give the Devil leave to operate the like things; and so nothing
firmly can be concluded from hence. Yet (I say) though these be
so, we shall pretermit them, and come to the full opening and discussion
of the matter; and that in these two particulars. 1. How
far the Devils power and assistance did concurr with the actions
and performances. 2. And wherein he did not concurr nor act at
all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ephes. 2. 2.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Tim. 3. 8.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. We shall grant that <em>Pharaoh</em> and the Magicians being Idolaters,
and worshippers of false gods, their ends were principally to magnifie
the power of their Idols, and to manifest that their supposed gods
could work, and bring to pass as strange miracles or wonders as
<em>Moses</em> and <em>Aaron</em> could perform by the assistance of the God of the
Hebrews; and in respect of this end they had all the assistance that
Satan and his dark kingdom of Angels could afford them in a spiritual
and hellish way; <em>for he is the Prince of the power of the air that
worketh in the children of disobedience</em>, for such were both <em>Pharaoh</em>
and his Magicians. And to this purpose doth the Apostle tell us,
speaking of false and seducing teachers: <em>That they were like Jannes,
and Jambres that withstood Moses, in their resisting of the truth</em>:
so that the Magicians of <em>Pharaoh</em> were condemned for resisting the
truth of that message that <em>Moses</em> and <em>Aaron</em> brought, and of those
real miracles that they performed; and so in respect of the wicked
end they aimed at, they were assisted with the power and concurrence
of the Devil, and in that respect only were his servants and
instruments.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as for the second particular, namely, the efficient causes and
means of the producing of those things that the Magicians did, we
affirm they were performed by the power of nature and art, and that
the Devil was no efficient cause of their production, and that by these
irrefragable arguments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. Those that affirm that the Devil did or can produce such strange
effects, do also acknowledge, that what he performeth in natural
and elementary Bodies, is done by applying natural agents to natural
and fit patients, which do truly bring to pass such strange effects,
and that he doth no more, but only make the local application of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>them. From whence it must necessarily follow that the effects flow
from natural agents, and so no causality at all can be ascribed unto
him, except that fictitious one of being <i><span lang="la">causa sine qua non</span></i>, which is
as much as no cause. And besides that, there is no proof that he
maketh this local application; for if he be incorporeal, then it is
simply impossible that he should perform any such matter; and however,
a man by natural power and means, if he know the fit and apt
actives and passives, may perform them himself, and so his assistance
is needless; and we have never yet met with any argument that bore
any convincing force that might induce us to believe that he is so
great a Naturalist.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De secret. oper. Art. &#38; natur.</span></i> <em>c.</em> 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 30. 37, 38, 39. <em>&#38;c.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. There are many persons that think themselves no mean sharers
in the most sorts of learning, and others that are very strait laced in
their pretended zeal for godliness, and in detesting the works of Satan,
that even startle and shew an abhorrency at the word Magick, if it
be but once named, as though there were no Magick but what is
diabolical, or that which they call diabolical were any other way
evil but only in the end and use: for there are many plants and minerals,
that though poysonous, are yet notwithstanding good in respect
of their Creation, and the good uses that may be made of them,
as to kill noxious animals that are hurtful unto man. But if any
force of malice and wickedness should use them to poyson and destroy
Men and Women, it were wicked and diabolical in the end
and use, yet were the means lawful and natural. So whatsoever the
Devil may do by wicked Men, his instruments, in leading and drawing
them to make use of the great <em>magnalia naturæ</em>, to work strange
wonders by, thereby to confirm Idolatry and Superstition, or to resist
the truth and such devilish ends, though the end and use may be
wicked and diabolical, yet the efficient cause is natural and lawful.
And therefore we can find no other ground or reason of dividing
Magick into natural and Diabolical, but only that they differ
in the end and use: for otherwise they both work by a natural agency
and means, seeing the Devil can do nothing above or contrary
to that course that God hath set in nature. Therefore may men do
without the aid of Devils whatsoever they can do, seeing they have
no advantage over us, but operate only by applying active things
to passive, like as Men do: And therefore said that most learned
Philosopher, Chymist and Mathematician, our Countreyman <em>Roger
Bacon</em>, excellent well in these words: <i><span lang="la">non igitur oportet nos uti
magicis illusionibus cum potestas Philosophiæ doceat operari quod sufficit</span></i>.
Therefore are those men that came from the East to worship
Christ called Magicians, not because that great knowledge they
had in the secrets of Nature was Diabolical or unlawful; for the
name of a Magician was honourable and laudable, until Knaves and
Impostors made use of it to cheat and couzen withal, and for wicked
and ungodly ends; but because they had made use of it for the
glory of God, and the good of mankind, therefore were they Magicians
in the genuine, and best sense, as working by lawful and natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>means, and to a good end: when the Magicians of <em>Pharaoh</em>
may be called Cacomagicians, because they used the good and excellent
causes and agents of nature to a wicked and Diabolical end,
namely to resist the truth: and so the only difference of Magick is
from the end and uses, and not from the causes or agents, that are
both natural. So what these Magicians of <em>Pharaoh</em> did, though it
were strange and wonderful, yet was it meerly by natural means
and causes; and yet being for a wicked end was therefore Diabolical.
So <em>Jacob</em> when he <em>set the pilled rods with white streakes in
them, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs, that
when the Rams and the Sheep came up to drink, and coupled together,
they might conceive and bring forth ring-streaked, speckled
and spotted young ones; It came so to pass</em>, and is confessed by <em>Pererius</em>
himself, and the most of learned Expositors upon that place,
to be from natural causes, and was a strange feat of natural Magick;
but not evil because not directed to a wicked end: but that
of <em>Pharaohs</em> though wrought likewise by a natural causes (for so it
was whether ascribed to the Devil, that can but work by natural
means, or not) was wicked and Diabolical; because they did it to
resist <em>Moses</em> and <em>Aaron</em> the messengers of the Lord Jehovah.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. The most or all the learned Expositors that have Commented
upon this place of <em>Exodus</em> (as may be seen in Dr. <em>Willets Hexapla</em>
and divers other learned Authors) though they attribute these
things done by the Magicians to the power and assistance of Satan,
yet in the manner they do acknowledge them not to be done really
and in truth, but only in shew and appearance. But what they
mean by shew and appearance is not so easie to find out and determine;
for if by it they mean, that they did it as Juglers and those
that use the Art of Leger-de-main do, that is, by shewing one thing,
and then by nimble sleight and agility convey it away, and suddainly
and unperceiveably substitute another thing in its place,
which they perform by leading the Eyes and attentions of the spectators
another way with staring and using of strange and insignificant
words, then we should be soon accorded, for so they might
probably and easily have been performed as we shall prove anon,
but this is not the thing they mean or intend. But some do mean
that the Devil did only deceive the Phantasie and imagination of
the beholders, in causing them to imagine and believe that the rods
were changed into Serpents, when they were not changed at all,
but only their imaginations deceived in thinking them to be Serpents
when they were but only rods, as melancholy persons, Men
in Feavers, Phrensies and Maniacal distempers do often think and
affirm that they see strange things when they see no such things externally,
but the Phantasie is only deceived with the species and
images of those things within. This might be granted if <em>Pharaoh</em>
and all the Spectators could be proved to be Men under those forenamed
distempers and the like, though yet that might (and doth
often) come to pass from meer natural causes, where the Devil hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>nothing to do at all. But the beholders of these actions of the Magicians
are neither proved, nor can rationally be supposed to be
Men under any such distempers; but must be understood to be Men
of several constitutions, tempers, and of sound health, and therefore
not any way capable of any such illusions, neither could the
Devil in a moment have so vitiated their imaginations, which we
affirm he can no ways do, except the humours, fumes and spirits
in the Body be first altered by natural causes, which cannot be
done instantaneously, and if it could, then it would follow that no
Man could certainly tell, when he were deceived in his imagination,
when not: neither could it be, (as some imagine,) by casting
a mist before their Eyes; for though Christ did hold the two Disciples
Eyes going from <em>Emaus</em>, that they did not know him, it
were blasphemous to think that Satan could do so also. And a mist casting
before their Eyes might make them to see more dimly and confusedly,
and cause things to appear greater than they were, but not
to make one thing seem a quite contrary. But it never was yet proved
that Satan could do such a thing, and what was never proved,
may safely and rationally be denied. Some do suppose that the Devil
did cloath or cover the Magicians rods with some such vestment
of an airy substance, as might make the rods appear to the eye like
Serpents; but this is as groundless a whimsey as any of the rest, and
as it hath no proof, so it needs no confutation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. But to come more close to the matter, it is most plain and
perspicuous that what they did was meerly by Art, or by Art and
Nature joined with it; for if we may trust any thing to propriety
of the words (as we have proved sufficiently before) they are called
<em>mechassephim</em>, <em>præstigiatores</em>, that is Juglers, such as by sleight
of hand, and nimble conveyance, could perform strange and wonderful
things, and after they are called <em>Hartummin</em>, that is, Magicians,
such as had skill in natural things, and by knowing their
causes, and making due and timely application of them to passives
that were suitable, could produce wonderful effects. And if we
seriously consider the few things that they performed, they might
easily be brought to pass by Leger-de-main alone. For, as for holding
a rod in their hands, and seeming to throw it down upon the
ground, how soon might they throw down an artificial Serpent in
its stead, and immediately and unperceivedly make conveyance of
the rod? And if it be thought difficult or impossible, I shall unriddle
the mystery, as I have sometimes seen it performed, and is but
thus. The Jugler that is to perform this feat is usually provided
before-hand with a wiar so twined and wrested, that it may be
pressed together with the little finger in the ball of the hand, and
when let loose it will extend it self, like a spring, and make a pretty
motion upon a Table, this is fitted with a suitable head, and a
piece of neatly painted linnen, perfectly resembling a Serpent, with
Eyes and all. This thus fitted he holdeth in his right hand betwixt
his little finger, and the ball of his hand, then with his left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>hand he taketh up a little white rod that he hath upon the Table,
with which he maketh people believe he performeth all his feats:
And then telling them a Story to amuse them, that he will like <em>Moses</em>
and <em>Aaron</em>, transform that rod into a Serpent, then he presently
beginneth to stare about him, and to utter some strange and nonsensical
words, as though he were invoking some Spirit or Goblin,
and so immediately conveyeth the rod either into his lap (if sitting)
or into his sleeve (if standing) and then lets loose the Serpent
forth of his right hand with pushing it forward, that what
with the wiar, and the nimble motion of his hand, he maketh it to
move a pretty space upon the Table, which he continueth, while offering
with the one hand to catch it by the neck, he nimbly with
the other puts it forward, and turneth it by touching the tail,
and the mean while hisseth so cunningly, that the by-standers think
it is the Serpent it self, and presently whips it up and conveys it
into his pocket. And such a trick as this well acted might
make <em>Pharaoh</em> and the beholders believe there was as much done, as
<em>Moses</em> and <em>Aaron</em> did, but only that <em>Aarons</em> rod swallowed up
their Serpents, or his Serpent theirs, which they might easily excuse.
As for the changing water into blood, and the producing
of Frogs, they were so easy to be done after the same manner, that
they need not any particular explication, for by this the manner of
their performance may most easily be understood. Though I once
saw a Gentleman that was much delighted with these kind of tricks,
and did himself play them admirable well, who performed it with
a living Snake, that he had got for one of his Children to keep in
a box; for in this North Countrey they are plentiful, and are also
innoxious; and it might have deceived a very wary person. So
that it is very foolish and absurd to bring in a Demon from Hell, or
an Angel from Heaven, or a Soul from above, to solve a thing
that seems strange and uncouth by, when the craft and cunning of
Men (if duely considered and examined) are sufficient to perform the
same, and much more.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. And in this place of Exodus where our Translators say: <em>and
the Magicians did so</em> or in like manner <em>with their inchantments</em>,
the word being <em>Belahatehem</em> ought to have been rendered, <i><span lang="la">suis laminis</span></i>
(as we have proved before) that is, with their bright plates
of metal, for the word doth not signifie Inchantments in any one
place in all the Old Testament. And if truth and reason may bear
any sway at all, it must be understood that they were deeply skilled
in natural and lawful Magick (as generally the <em>Ægyptians</em> and the
Eastern Nations were) though they did use and apply it to an evil
end, namely the resisting the power of Gods miracles wrought by
<em>Moses</em> and <em>Aaron</em>: and so by this word <i><span lang="la">suis laminis</span></i>, with their
plates of Metal must be understood, Metalline bright plates framed under
certain fit constellations, and insculped with certain figures, by
which naturally (without any Diabolical assistance) they did perform
strange things, and made the shapes of some things appear to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>eye. And though we may be derided and laughed to scorn by the
ignorant, or hardly taxed and censured by the greatest part of Cynical
Criticks, yet we cannot so far stifle the knowledge of our
own brains, nor be so cowardly in maintaining the truth, but we
must assert, That anciently there hath been a certain lawful art,
whereby some sorts of metals might be mixed together under a due
constellation, and after ingraven in like fit Planetary times with
sundry figures, that would naturally work strange things; And this
piece of learning though it may justly be numbred amongst the
<i><span lang="it">Desiderata</span></i>, and might very well have been placed in the Catalogue
of the <i><span lang="la">Deperdita</span></i> of <i><span lang="la">Pancirollus</span></i>; yet was it well known unto
the ancient Magicians, and by them often with happy success
put into practise; And amongst those many noble attempts of that
most learned and experienced (though much condemned) person
<em>Paracelsus</em>, this part of learning was not the least, that he laboured
to restore. The truth of which we thus prove.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. That there have been formerly in the World many such like planetary
Sigills or Talismans, (as the <em>Persians</em> called them) is manifest
from the authority of divers Authors of good credit and account.
For the learned and most acute <em>Julius Scaliger</em> relateth this saying:
“The novelty of this History also may sharpen the wits of the studious.
In the Books of the <em>Arabick Ægyptians</em> (he saith) it is thus
written. That <em>Hameth Ben Thaulon</em> the Governour of <em>Ægypt</em> for
the <em>Arabians</em> did command that a certain leaden Image or Picture
of a Crocodile, which was found in the ground-work of a certain
Temple, should be melted in the fire. From which time the inhabitants
did complain, that those Countreys were more infested
with Crocodiles than before, against whose mischief that Image
had been framed, and buried there by the more ancient Wise-men
or Magicians. <em>Junctin</em>, upon the Sphear of <em>Sacrobosco</em>, affirms
that his Master who was a <em>Carmelite</em>, named <i><span lang="co">Julianus Ristorius à
Prato</span></i>, one that was not any whit superstitious, was intreated by
a Friend of his to make one of these Images for the cure of the
Cramp, which he was very much subject to. This learned Man
resenting his Friends sufferings, taught him the manner how to
make one: so that he, not content to make only one, made divers
of them when the Moon was in the Sign <em>Cancer</em>; and that
with so good success, and with such certainty, as that he immediately
found the benefit of it. <i><span lang="la">Confecit</span></i> (saith he) <i><span lang="la">plures imagines,
pro se, &#38; amicis suis: quibus effectis, unam pro se accepit,
&#38; liberatus est</span></i>. The same he reports of a certain Florentine, a
very Pious Man, who made one of these Talismans, for to
drive away the <em>Gnats</em>, which he did with good success. <em>Nicolaus
Florentinus</em>, (saith he) <i><span lang="la">Vir religiosus fecit in una constellatione

sub certis &#38; determinatis imaginibus; &#38; usus fuit constellatione
Saturni infortunati, &#38; expulit culices</span></i>.” Another Story
take from an Arabick Cosmographer, cited by <em>Joseph Scaliger</em> thus:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“This Talisman (he saith) is to be seen in the Countrey of <em>Hamptz</em>,
in a City bearing the same name; and it is only the Figure of a
Scorpion graved upon one of the Stones in a certain Tower;
which is of so great virtue, as that it suffers not any, either Serpent
or Scorpion to come within the City. And if any one, for
experiment sake, bring one of these out of the field into the City,
it is no sooner at the Gate, but that it dies suddenly. This Figure
hath this virtue besides; that when any one is stung with a
Scorpion, or bitten by any other Serpent, they need but take
the Image of the Stone with a little clay, and apply it to the
wound, and it is instantly healed.” Unto which Mr. <em>Gaffarel</em> addeth
this: “If any one doubt (saith he) of the credit of this Cosmographer,
he may yet adventure to believe Mr. <i><span lang="la">de Breves</span></i>, as
having been an eye-witness of the like experiment: who says in
his Travels, that at <em>Tripoli</em> a City of <em>Syria</em>, within a Wall that
reacheth from the Sea-side to the Gate of the City, there is a certain
inchanted stone; on which is figured, in Relief, or by way
of Imbossment, the Figure of a Scorpion, which was there placed
by a Magician, for to drive away Venomous Beasts, which infested
this Province, as the Serpent of Brass in the Hippodromus
at <em>Constantinople</em> did. And a little above the City, there is a certain
Cave, which is full of the Carkasses and Bones of Serpents,
which died at that time.” And further <em>Gaffarel</em> saith: “Now whereas
he calls this an inchanted Stone, and says that it was placed
there by a Magician, you must note, that he there speaks according
to the sense of the inhabitants, who knew not how to give any other
account of the thing, as not understanding any thing at all of
the natural reason of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>2. And that the election of fit times according to the Configuration
of the Stars and Planets, is of great efficacy and virtue, is sufficiently
known to Husbandmen and Sailers, and of no small power
both in respect of natural and artificial things, as we shall shew in
this instance. <em>Lazarus Riverius</em> who was Counsellor and Physician
to the French King, a person of extraordinary learning and experience
in the Medical profession, both in the Galenical and Chymical
way, doth give us this relation saying: “I have not seldom
experienced, and I have many witnesses of this thing, that Peony
gathered under its proper Constellation, to wit, the Moon inclining
(<i><span lang="la">inclinante</span></i>) being in <em>Aries</em>, doth loose the <em>Epilepsie</em>, by application
alone: for the middle and chief root divided by the
greater Longitude, I have (he saith) compassed about the neck
and the armes of a certain Virgin in the Hospital, of eighteen
years of age, who had been afflicted with this Disease from her
childhood, and had the <em>Paroxysmes</em> every day; but from that day
seemed altogether to be cured. From whence it is manifest how
greatly the observation of the Stars is to be esteemed of in the
Art of Medicine.” Agreeable unto which is the judgment of that
Industrious person <em>Galen</em>, who affirmeth that Peony by appension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>doth cure the <em>Epilepsie</em>, though he declare not the fit time for its
collection. From whence it is most clear that the careful and precise
observation of the Heavenly influences is most necessary to a
Physician, and to all others that would produce strange and desired
effects. Therefore doth learned <em>Schroderus</em> tell us this concerning
the power and efficacy of those influences, saying: “The influences
of the Stars are <em>effluvia</em>, or Steams endowed with peculiar faculties,
by which they make strong (if they be in their strength
and vigour) things that are familiar to them, and do prosper and
promote their virtues; but on the contrary they debilitate, hinder
and make worse things that are not agreeable to them.” And
this is that which <em>Moses</em> fully mentioneth in these words, as they
are fitly rendred by <em>Arias Montanus</em>. <i><span lang="la">Et ad</span></i> Joseph <i><span lang="la">dixit, Benedicta
Domini terra ejus, de delicia Cœlorum, de rore, &#38; de voragine
cubante deorsum: &#38; de delicia proventuum Solis, &#38; de delicia
ejectionis lunarum</span></i>. Which our Translation gives thus: <em>And of Joseph
he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things
of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath; And
for the precious fruits brought forth by the Sun, and for the precious
things put forth by the Moon</em>. The full evidence of the truth of
these influences of the Stars, and necessity and utility for due and proper
seasons for the collection of Flowers, Fruits, Roots and Plants,
may be seen in that learned piece that <em>Bartholomæus Carichterus</em>
Chief Physician to <em>Maximilian</em> the Second, writ and dedicated
to his Master in the German Tongue. As also, what is written in
the same Language by those learned Germans, <em>Johannes Pharamundus
Rhumelius</em>, and <em>Israel Hebueras</em> that learned Mathematician,
in a Treatise which he calleth, <i><span lang="la">Mysterium Sigillorum herbarum &#38;
lapidum</span></i>, which do compleatly verifie the certain efficacy and virtue
of Planetary Seals, Images or Figures.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. These things are confirmed by the effects of appensions of many
natural things which produce strange and wonderful effects, some of
which we shall give in the words of that honourable person Mr. <em>Boyl</em>,
who saith: “That great cures may be done by bare outward applications,
you will scarce deny if you disbelieve not the relations
which are made us by learned men concerning the efficacy
of the <em>Lapis Nephriticus</em>, only bound upon the Pulses of the wrists
(chiefly that of the left hand) against that stubborn and Anomalous
disease the Stone. And that which gives the more credit to
these relations is; That not only the judicious <i><span lang="la">Anselmus Boetius
de Boot</span></i> seems to prize it, but the famous <em>Monardes</em> professeth
himself, not to write by hear-say of the great virtues of this <em>Indian
Stone</em>, but to have made tryal of it himself upon persons of
very high quality: And that which is related by <em>Monardes</em> is
much less strange than those almost incredible things which are
with many circumstances delivered of that Stone, by the learned
Chymist <em>Vutzerus</em>. And although it must be acknowledged that
some Stones that go under that name have been ineffectually applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>in Nephritick Distempers. Yet the accurate <em>Johannes de
Laet</em> himself furnisheth us with an answer to that objection, informing
us that many of those Nephritick Stones (which differ
much in colour, though the best are wont to be greenish) although
not at all counterfeited or sophisticated are of little or no
virtue. But that yet there are some others of them which can
scarce be distinguished from the former, but by tryal upon Nephriticks,
which are of wonderful efficacy, as he himself hath more
than once tryed in his own Wife. <em>Garcias ab orta</em> mentions a
Stone found in <em>Balagat</em>, called <em>Alaqueca</em>; of which he tells us,
that though it be cheap: <i><span lang="la">Hujus tamen virtus</span></i> (to use his own
words) <i><span lang="la">reliquarum Gemmarum facultates exuperat, quippe qui
sanguinem undequaq; fluentem illico sistat</span></i>. <em>Monardes</em> (<em>cap. 35.</em>)
relates the great virtues of a Stone against Hysterical suffocations,
and concludes; <i><span lang="la">Cum uteri suffocationem imminentem præsentiunt,
adhibito lapide subitò levantur, &#38; si eum perpetuò gestant (Hysterici)
nunquam simili morbo corripiuntur: exempla hujusmodi faciunt
ut his rebus fidem adhibeam</span></i>. The same Author in the next
Chapter, treating of the <em>Lapis Sanguinaris</em> or Blood-stone, found in
<em>New Spain</em> (having told us, that the <em>Indians</em> do most confidently
believe, that if the flesh of any bleeding part be touched with
this Stone, the bleeding will thereby be stanched) adds this memorable
observation of his own: <i><span lang="la">Vidimus nonnullos hæmorrhoidum
fluxu afflictos remedium sensisse, annulos ex hoc lapide confectos
in digito continue gestando; nec non &#38; menstruum fluxum
sisti</span></i>. And to these for brevity sake, we shall only mention the virtues
of the Jasper, which is blood-red throughout the whole
body of the Stone, which <em>Boetius de Boot</em> of his own experience
doth avouch in several trials to have stopped Fluxes of Blood, only
by bare appension: As also the child of a famous Chymical
writer, who had his child (supposed to be bewitched) cured by
hanging a piece of that Noble Mineral by <em>Paracelsus</em> called <i><span lang="la">electrum
minerale immaturum</span></i>, of which <em>Helmont</em> tells us this: <i><span lang="la">Imprimis
electrum minerale immaturum Paracelsi, collo appensum, liberat,
quos spiritus immundus persequitur, quod ipse vidi. Illius
potum verò plures à veneficiis solvisse, memini. Nemo autem, qui appenso
illo simplici, non præcaverit, ne injecta intromittantur: vel
ab importunis ligationibus confestim non solvatur.</span></i>” All which do
manifest the great and wonderful virtues, that God hath endowed
Stones, Minerals, Plants and Roots withal, that the Devil need
not be brought in to be an adjutant or operator in their effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. And it is also manifest that Metals may be so artificially in fit
Constellations commixed together, that their effects will be rare
and stupendious, as the aforesaid honourable person doth transcribe
and relate to us in these words: “What <em>Monardes</em>, (he
saith) mentions of the virtue of the <em>Lapis Sanguinaris</em> to cure
Hemorrhoidal Fluxes, puts me in mind of a yet much stranger
thing, which <em>Helmont</em> affirms, namely, That he could make a metal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of which if a Ring were worn, the pain of the Hæmorrhoids
would be taken away, in the little time requisite to recite the
Lords Prayer; and within twenty four hours the Hæmorrhoids
themselves, as well internal as external, how protuberant soever,
would vanish, and the restagnant blood would (as he speaks)
be received again into favour, and be restored to a good condition.
The same Ring he also commends in the suffocation and irregular
motion of the Womb, and divers other Diseases: But if
<em>Paracelsus</em> be in any case to be credited in an unlikely matter, we
may think by his very solemn protestations that he speaks upon
his own experience, that he had a Ring made of a metalline substance,
by him called <i><span lang="la">electrum</span></i>, (which by his description seems to
be a mixture of all the metals joined together under certain constellations)
which was of far greater virtue than this of <em>Helmont</em>,
For, <i><span lang="la">hoc loco</span></i> (says he) <i><span lang="la">non possum non indicare admirandas quasdam
vires virtutesq; electri nostri, quas fieri his nostris oculis vidimus,
adeoq; cum bona veritatis conscientiâ præferre attestariq;
possumus. Vidimus enim hujus generis annulos, quos qui induit,
hunc nec spasmus convulsit, nec Paralysis corripuit, nec dolor ullus
torsit, similiter nec Apoplexia, nec Epilepsia invasit. Et si annulus
hujusmodi Epileptici digito annulari, etiam in Paroxysmo sævissimo,
insertus fuit, remittente illicò Paroxysmo, æger à lapsu illico
resurrexit</span></i>, &#38;c.” And though Mr. <em>Boyle</em> a person of a perspicuous
judgment, and of a great understanding, doth seem to question his
authority with a kind of dubitation, being in probability staggered
by the groundless censures of his greatest adversaries; yet we must
affirm that it is very hard that his veracity and experience (which
was as great as any Mans) should be undervalued, by reason of the
ignorance and idleness of those that judge him: who were never
able in regard of their ignorance to understand the meaning of his
mystical and dark way of writing, nor because of their supine negligence
had ever made trial of those things he treateth of, with that
curious diligence and care that is requisite to accomplish such occult
effects withal; not considering that, <i><span lang="la">Dii sua bona laboribus
vendunt</span></i>. But notwithstanding this, and the monstrous lies and
horrid calumnies of that pitiful Rapsodist <em>Athanasius Kircherus</em>,
we shall add one testimony more from the same Author, which in
English runs thus: “Also (he saith) I cannot here pass over one
great wonder, which I saw performed in <em>Spain</em> of a great Negromancer,
who had a Bell not exceeding the weight of two pounds
which as oft as he did Ring, he could allure and stir up many and
various Apparitions and Visions of Spirits. For when he lift he
did describe certain words and characters in the inward superficies
of the Bell: After if he did beat and ring it, forthwith the Spirits
(for shapes) did come forth or appear of what form or shape soever
he desired. He could also by the sound of the same Bell, either
draw unto him or drive from him many other Visions and
Spirits, as also Men and Beasts, as I have seen many of these performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>by him with mine own eyes. But whensoever he did begin
any new thing, so oft he did renew the words and Characters also.
But notwithstanding he would not reveal (he saith) unto me,
those secrets of the words and characters, until I my self more
deeply weighing and considering the matter, at last by chance
found them forth. Which notwithstanding, and the examples of
which I here studiously do conceal. But it is not obscurely to be
noted here, that there was more of moment in the Bell, than in
the words: For this Bell was certainly and altogether compounded
or made of this our <i><span lang="la">Electrum</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>5. And that there are great and hidden virtues both in Plants and
Minerals, especially in Metals and Precious Stones as they are by Nature
produced by Mystical Chymistry prepared and exalted, or commixed
and insculped in their due and fit constellations, may not only
be proved by the instances foregoing, but also by the reasons and authorities
of persons of great judgment and experience in the secrets of
nature, of which we shall here recite some few. And first that learned
and observant person <em>Baptista van Helmont</em> tells us thus much: “But
this one thing (he saith) I willingly admit: To wit, that metals do by
many degrees surpass Plants and Minerals in the art of healing. And
therefore that metals are certain shining glasses, not by reason of
the brightness; but rather that as often as they are opened, and their
virtues set at liberty, they act by a dotal light, and a vital contact.
Therefore metals do operate, by a manner attributed to the Stars,
to wit by aspect, and the attraction of an alterative biass or motion.
For the metals themselves are glasses, I say the best off-spring
of the inferiour Globe, upon which the whole central
force, by some former ages, hath prodigally poured out its treasure,
that it might espouse most richly, this liquor, this sweat,
and this off-spring of Divine Providence, unto those ends which
the weakness of nature did require. But (he saith) I call them
shining glasses, which have the power of penetrating and illuminating
the <em>Archeus</em>, from its errors, furies and defects.” Neither
are those arguments of that learned person <em>Galeottus Martius</em>,
for defending the natural and lawful effects of Planetary Sigills,
when prepared forth of agreeable matter, and made in their due constellations,
of such small weight as some insipid ignorants have pretended,
but are convincing to any considerate and rational person,
as this one may manifest, where he is speaking of the Figure of a
Lion ingraven in a Golden Plate in these words: “The Figure of a
Lion (he saith) insculped in the fit hours, in a right constellation,
doth not act, but doth bring the beginning of the action, as S. <em>Thomas</em>
and <em>Albertus magnus</em> do testifie: not as a Figure and Image impressed
Mathematically, but that it may effect this or that preparation
in the thing figured: which may in divers moods receive the
Celestial action without difficulty: Because if the Image of a Dog,
or an Horse, or some other Animal were insculped in a Golden
Plate, there would not be that disposition of the matter, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>doth accompany the Image of a Lion &#38;c. From whence (he saith)
we conclude, that this aptitude to draw in the Celestial virtue in
the Figure, is not as Figure, but as the Gold is formed more dense
or thin, by the condition of the Image. For even in looking-glasses,
the variety of the Figure, doth bring a most vast difference.
For how much a Concave doth differ from a gibbous
Looking-glass, is even known unto old Wives.” Of these things
also our learned Countreyman <em>Roger Bacon</em>, who was second to
none in the secrets of Art and Nature, doth teach us thus much:
“But they who know in fit constellations, to do their works according
to the configurations of the Heavens; they may not only
dispose Characters, but all their operations, both of Art and Nature,
agreeable to the Celestial virtues. But because it is difficult in
these things to know the certitude of Celestials; therefore in
these there is much error with many; and there are few that know
to order any thing profitably and truly.” But we shall shut up this
particular with that memorable and irrefragable responsion of <em>Paracelsus</em>
to the common objection, which in English runs thus:
“But (he saith) they will thus urge; how comes it to pass, I pray
thee, that Metals, with their assigned Characters, Letters and
Names, should perform such things, unless they be prepared and
made by Magical and Diabolical power intervening? But (he
saith) to these I return this answer. Therefore thou believest (as I
hear) that if such things be made by the help of the Devil, then
they may have their force and operations. But should not thou
rather believe this? that also the Creator of Nature, God who
dwelleth in the Heavens, is so powerful, that he in like manner
can give and confer these virtues and operations to Metals,
Roots, Herbs, Stones and such like things? As though forsooth
the Devil were more strong, more wise, more omnipotent, and more
powerful than the only Eternal, Omnipotent and Merciful God, who
hath created and exalted their degrees, even of all these aforesaid
Metals, Stones, Herbs, Roots and all other such like things that
are above, or within the Earth, and do live and vegetate in the
Water or Air, for the health and commodity of Man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>This argument we desire that any of the Witchmongers or Demonographers
should answer, ere they conclude so strongly for the
power of Devils and Witches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Exod. 8. 19.</div>

<p class='c008'>So we conceive we have sufficiently proved that what <em>Pharaohs</em>
Magicians did perform, might rationally, and probably be brought
to pass by Natural Magick or confederacy, and sleight of hand,
without any other Diabolical assistance than what was mental and
spiritual in regard of the end, which was the resisting of <em>Moses</em>.
And by all they did, as in changing their Rods, bringing in of Frogs
and changing Water into Blood, it doth not rationally appear,
that they had any supernatural assistance, for then they could not
have been so amazed at the miracle of turning the Dust into Lice;
for what skill did the Devil want that he could not perform this?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>If by his power the former things were brought to pass, could there
be more difficulty in doing of this, than in the bringing of Frogs?
Neither could their Legierdemain have failed them but that they were
surprized, and taken unawares, being not provided to play all kind
of tricks, but only some few for which they had made provision.
And so to excuse their own inability, they cryed out, <em>this is the finger
of God</em>; a pitiful shift to excuse their own knavery, and couzenage,
for there could be no more of the finger of God in this than the former,
but only a shift to put off their own shame.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another place from whence they would draw arguments to
maintain the power of the Devil and Witches, is the Story of <em>Balaam</em>
in the Book of <em>Numbers</em>, from whence in the first place they
would conclude that he used wicked and Diabolical Divinations,
and that by words he could either bless or curse. In answer to which
we shall give these pressive reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Numb. 22. 6.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Numb. 23. 8, 23.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Though it might be granted that he used Divinations that
were not lawful, yet what is that to a killing and murthering Witch?
Surely nothing at all. And though <em>Balak</em> believed that <em>whosoever
he blessed were blessed, and whosoever he cursed, were cursed</em>, and
therefore fetched him so far, yet there is nothing apparent to prove
that <em>Balaam</em> could do any such matter, and from <em>Balaks</em> belief to
<em>Balaams</em> performances proceedeth no argument, for his belief that
he could either bless or curse, did not confer any power to <em>Balaam</em>
to produce such effects withall. And <em>Balaams</em> blessings, or cursings
might be intentional, and declarative, but could not be effective,
for he confesseth a great piece of truth: <em>How should he curse, whom
God had not cursed, or how should he defie, whom the Lord had not
defied?</em> He might have done it verbally, but it would have been frustrate,
and to no effect, and therefore he concluded: <em>Surely there
was no inchantment against Jacob, nor no Divination against Israel</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Chap. 24. 1.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. And though it be said, that he went not as at other times, to
meet Auguries (for as we have before shewed, the word doth properly
signifie that) It must be understood, and is manifest that at
the former times he went to attend solitarily what the Lord would
say unto him, and those two times that he went before was only to
meet the Lord, to hear and receive what he would say unto him.
But here he did not, nor had need to go, for the Spirit of the Lord
came upon him, and he took up his Parable, and prophesied. Where
though his going to meet the Lord, be called to meet Divinations,
yet it cannot be taken in the worse sense, for unlawful Divinations,
but for such as were sent him and taught him by God, by Visions,
Angels, Trances, or other such like wayes as God in those times
used to reveal his Will to his Prophets by: For from first to last, it
appeareth that he neither professed, nor did (in this case) utter any
thing but what the Lord commanded him, and so was no false Prophet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Numb. 22. 18.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid</em> <em>c.</em> 24. 4, 16.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Caten. Aur. Tho. Aquin.</em> <em>p.</em> 10.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. He was no false Prophet, that is, he had, nor used any Divinations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>but what he had from God, is most clear from these particulars.
1. When <em>Balak</em> first sent messengers unto him, his responsion
was: <em>If Balak would give me his house full of Silver and Gold
I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do less or
more</em>. “Whereby it is apparent that he feared the Lord Jehovah,
and calls him his God, thereby shewing the confidence that he had
in him, and that he acknowledged him for his only God. 2. In the
whole transaction of the business betwixt him and <em>Balak</em>, he never
took upon him to declare any thing, but what the Lord would
say unto him, neither did he at all vary from the same in the least
tittle.” 3. He confesseth all along, <em>that he had his eyes opened, and
that he heard the words of God, and had seen the vision of the Almighty,
falling into a trance, but having his eyes open</em>. And these
were things that were not peculiar to any, but such as were the true
Prophets of the Lord Jehovah. 4. The truth of his Prophecie,
which was of the Kingdom of Christ, and the Glory and Dominion
of it, with the prosperity of his people, doth plainly evince that
he was a true Prophet of the Lord, and that his Divinations came
from the Almighty. And this caused S. <em>Hierome</em>, and some other
of the Fathers believe, that by this Prophecie of <em>Balaam</em>, the <em>Magi</em>
or Wise men were directed, to come to <em>Hierusalem</em> to seek and
worship Christ the Saviour of the World.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Though this Prophet fell into hainous crimes, and enormous
sins, as tempting of God, who when the first Messengers came
from <em>Balak</em> unto him, was positively commanded not to go with
them, and yet as though God would change his mind entertained
them again, whereby Gods anger was kindled against him. And
though he was drawn <em>to love the wages of unrighteousness</em>, and so
was rebuked by the dumb Ass, and though <em>he taught Balak to lay a
stumbling-block before the children of Israel</em>, and therefore had that
judgment to be slain among the Midianites: Yet none of these do
conclude at all, that therefore he used Diabolical Divinations, or
had not what he declared from Divine Revelation, no more than
the flying of <em>Jonah</em> to <em>Tarshish</em>, when he was commanded to go to
preach against <em>Nineveh</em>, or his repining at Gods mercy shewed to that
great City, manifested him to be a lying Prophet, or to use devilish
Divination. Neither the Prophets being seduced, <em>that cried against
the altar at Bethel</em>, before <em>Jeroboam</em>, by the old Prophet, <em>and his
being slain in the way by a lion, &#38; his carkase left there</em>, did at all argue
that his Prophecie was false, or that he had not his message from God,
but they only shew, that even those that have been truly inspired
by God and been truly taught by him, have notwithstanding often
disobeyed him, and have had therefore fearful temporal judgments
faln upon them, and yet no argument that they used unlawful Divinations.</p>

<p class='c008'>From hence also the Witchmongers use to urge a frivolous and
groundless argument which is this; that the Angel did speak in
<em>Balaams</em> Ass, and therefore the Devil may speak in a Dog, or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Cat to a Witch, but this is confuted by these reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. What the Angel did there was by command and commission
from God, but we never read, nor can it be proved that the Devil
is sent upon such idle, and ordinary errands, to work a miracle, to
speak in a Dog, or a Cat, to a Witch; for God doth not work
wonders for any such wicked and abominable ends. And if he be
not sent of God, he cannot of himself perform any such matter, who
could not enter into the Swine, without Christs leave and order;
but is kept in chains of everlasting darkness, from whence he is
not loosed, but when God sends him as an instrument to accomplish
his will, which is always for good and just ends, and not for
such execrable and wicked purposes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Numb. 22. 26, 27.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Verse 28.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. They take up a false supposition, for the Angel was not in the
Ass either essentially, or effectively, for at the very instant that
the Ass spoke, <em>the Angel was standing in a narrow place, where was
no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left</em>, and then <em>seeing
the Angel of the Lord she fell down under Balaam, and spoke</em>, and
the Angel could not both stand in the narrow way and likewise be
in the Ass, in the same moment of time, except we should grant
that absurdity that a creature may be in two distinct places at one
and the self same time, which was never yet allowed to any created
being. But they openly belie, and falsifie the words of the Text,
for it doth not say that the Angel spoke in the Ass, but that the
Lord, (the word is <em>Jehovah</em>) opened the mouth of the Ass. So
that (we suppose) here is enough demonstrated that from
none of the places of Scriptures hitherto enumerated, any colourable
grounds can be drawn to uphold those particulars that we have
laboured to confute, and therefore we shall pass to another
Chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Of the Woman of</em> Endor <em>that pretended to raise up</em> Samuel, <em>and

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Concerning the Woman of <em>Endor</em>, that our English and many other
Translators have falsly rendered a Witch, or a Woman that had a
familiar Spirit, we have spoken sufficiently, where we treated of the
signification of the word <em>Ob</em>. And there have shewed plainly, that she
is only called the Mistriss of the bottle, or of the Oracle, and that
what she there did, or pretended to do, was only by Ventriloquy,
or casting her self into a feigned Trance lay groveling upon the
earth with her face downwards, and so changing her voice did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>mutter and murmur, and peep and chirp like a bird coming forth of
the shell, or that she spake in some hollow Cave or Vault, through
some Pipe, or in a Bottle, and so amused and deceived poor timerous
and despairing <em>Saul</em>, or had a confederate apparelled like Samuel
to play his part, and that it was neither <em>Samuels</em> Body, Soul,
nor no Ghost or Devil, but only the cunning and Imposture of the
Woman alone, or assisted with a confederate. And though this
might be amply satisfactory to all sound and serious judgments, especially
if hereunto be added what Mr. <em>Scot</em>, Mr. <em>Ady</em>, Mr. <em>Wagstaff</em>,
and the learned Authors of the Dialogue of Spirits and Devils
have written upon this subject: yet because we have promised before
to speak something of the History and matter of fact, and that
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> a Minister of our English Church hath of late espoused
the quarrel, we shall confute his arguments and clear the case as fully
as in reason can be required, and that in these particulars following.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The certain and infallible prophecies of <em>Samuel</em> so punctually
coming to pass according as he foretold them, for it is said: <em>And
Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his
words fall to the ground</em>; were manifestly known to all <em>Israel</em>, as
in the case of the destruction of <em>Eli</em>, and his house, and by the overthrow
of the <em>Philistines</em> at <em>Eben-ezer</em>, and in the anointing of
<em>Saul</em> to be King, and in the case of sending Thunder and Lightning
in Harvest time, and such like. And as these were publickly known
unto all <em>Israel</em>, and they had seen, and tryed what infallible certainty
followed upon them, so it was as generally known, that <em>Samuel</em>
had told <em>Saul</em> that God had rejected him from being King over
<em>Israel</em>, and that he had anointed <em>David</em> to be King in his stead;
and therefore any rational Man, that knew these things, and also
saw that <em>David</em> prospered in all things that he did, and that it was
quite otherwise with <em>Saul</em>, might certainly know that the Kingdome
would be transferred from him unto <em>David</em>, and so there
needed neither spirit nor Devil be fetched up to predict this, being
sufficiently known unto all, of which also the Woman at <em>Endor</em>
could not be ignorant as a thing of concern to her, especially in the
point of her practise which was meer couzenage and Imposture.
And therefore Mr. <em>Glanvils</em> argument concludes nothing, where he
saith: “And this <em>Samuel</em> truly foretold his approaching fate, <em>viz.</em>
That <em>Israel</em> should be delivered with him into the hands of the
<em>Philistines</em>, and that on the morrow he, and his Sons should be
in the state of the dead, which doubtless is meant by the expression
that [<em>they should be with him</em>:] which contingent particulars,
how could the couzener, and her confederate foretel, if there
were nothing in it extraordinary and preternatural?” To answer
which we say, that there was no contingent particular that was foretold,
but Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> might have foretold it, if he had been there,
and known but that which was publickly divulged in <em>Israel</em>, without
incurring the danger of being reputed a Witch or a Diviner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isa. 63. 16.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>1. Because <em>Samuels</em> prophecies were certainly known to come to
pass, and he had openly declared, that the Kingdom should be rent
from <em>Saul</em>, and given to <em>David</em>. 2. She or her confederate might
have guessed as much, because of the extream fear and consternation
that <em>Saul</em> was in, for heartless and fearful Generals seldom or
never win Battels. 3. Because that he confessed that God had
forsaken him, and when he saw the hoast of the <em>Philistines</em>, he was
afraid and his heart greatly trembled, and those that God doth
forsake cannot prosper. 4. The word <em>to morrow</em> in the Hebrew
doth not precisely denote the day following, but the time to come,
so that how true soever Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> may think it, there was but
a piece of ambiguous Equivocation in it, for it cannot be made out
that it was fought the very next day, neither were all <em>Sauls</em> Sons
slain with him, at that very time. 5. And if nothing must be supplied
but meerly what is <i><span lang="la">totidem verbis</span></i> in the Text (as he urgeth
against Mr. <em>Scot</em>) then how will it be proved, that the Phrase (<em>to
morrow thou and thy Sons shall be with me</em>) is to be understood of
the state of the dead, seeing the words (if literally to be taken)
do imply a locality, not a state or condition? 6, But if it be supposed
to be the Devil, how comes he to know contingencies so
certainly? It is a thing that is easily affirmed, but was never yet sufficiently
proved. For if it be said he gathered it from the Prophecie
of <em>Samuel</em>, so might the Witch have done without any assistance
of a Devil. 7. And if he take it to be <em>Samuels</em> Soul (as he seems
to hold) how come departed Souls to know, and foresee what contingent
effects are to fall out here below? Where reads he or finds
any such Divinity except in Popish Authors? But he may consult
the Text: <em>Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant
of us, and Israel acknowledge us not</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Sam. 9. 2. &#38; 10. 23.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. That this Woman was a meer dissembling and lying cheater,
and used nothing but Imposture, is manifest from these reasons.
1. Because that she was but of the same Crew and Stamp that <em>Manasseh</em>,
and <em>Ahab</em> set up, is most plain, but they were meer Impostors
and deceivers pretending to divine for other persons, and in
other matters, but could not foresee their own destruction, and
therefore in probability she was of the same practice. 2. Because she
falsly faigned that she knew not <em>Saul</em>, of whom she could not be ignorant,
he being so publickly known, and seen, and was taller by
the head and shoulders than any man in <em>Israel</em>. 3. If she had not
known that it had been <em>Saul</em>, when he came to her at the first, she
would never have relyed upon his oath when he swore by <em>Jehovah</em>,
for there was none but the King that could protect her from destruction.
4. She must needs be a most notorious dissembling cheater,
because she pretended to call up any, for she said: <em>whom shall I
bring up unto thee?</em> which is most certainly false, she had no such
universal power, no nor all the Devils in Hell, if they had all assisted
her. 5. She did plainly dissemble, for the Text saith, <em>and when
the woman saw Samuel she cried out with a loud voice</em>; now if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>she saw <em>Samuel</em> (whom he could not but know) why did she answer
to <em>Saul</em>, when he asked, <em>what sawest thou?</em> She answered, <em>I
saw gods ascending out of the earth</em>. Let Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, and all men
judge if this be not gross and palpable lying, Gods is plural, but
<em>Samuel</em> was but one.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Sam. 15. 23, 27.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Sam. 28. 6.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. As it is manifest that this Woman was an active deceiver, and
one that intended to cheat and couzen, so it is as plain that <em>Saul</em>
was in a condition fit to be deluded, and imposed upon, even by
those that had been less cunning and skilful than she was in the
craft of cheating, which is apparent from these reasons. 1. The
Spirit of the Lord was departed from him, and consequently, Wisdom,
Prudence and Discretion, and so that which should have
guided his Will, Affections and Actions in the right way, had totally
left him. And when these are gone, what is man, but a fit instrument
to undergo and suffer even the worst and lowest of delusions
and abuses? 2. The Spirit of the Lord had not only left him,
but an evil Spirit from the Lord was come upon him that vexed and
terrified him. And to what madness, folly and wickedness is not
he subject to, who is led by the Spirit of lies and darkness? 3. The
Lord had openly declared, that because he had rejected the word
of the Lord, therefore the Lord had rejected him from being King over
<em>Israel</em>, and that the Kingdom should be rent from him, and given
to one more worthy than him. Now what despondency of
mind, what torture and vexation of Spirit must needs be in him,
that having been a King, is thus threatned to have his Kingdom
rent from him and given to another, is easy to be imagined. 4. He
must needs be under a most fearful consternation of mind not only
because of these things named, but especially having before in his
dangers and straights received counsel and advice from the Lord,
though he now <em>inquired of the Lord, yet the Lord answered him
neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by Prophets</em>. The Lord answered
him not by dreams; for the union and converse that had
been betwixt him and the Lord before, was now broken by reason
of his Sins and Rebellion. Neither did the Lord answer him by
Urim, for the Urim was not in the possession then of <em>Saul</em>, but of
<em>David</em>, Chap. 23. 6, 9. Neither did the Lord answer him by Prophets,
for <em>Samuel</em> had left him, after his last denouncing judgment
against him, and came no more at him until his death. 5. He must
needs be in a most fearful case, and a fit subject for the most weak
and simple Imposture of the World, because the <em>Philistines</em> were
upon him with a potent and numerous Army, and he able to gather
but few and weak forces, the best and most of the people being
revolted from him, and were in their affections, or persons
with and for <em>David</em>. And from hence may easily be collected, how
facile a thing it was to delude, and deceive <em>Saul</em>, even by those that
had far less craft than this Woman, who doubtless was devilish cunning
in her couzening tricks.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. There is much question who was the Penman of this first Book
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>of <em>Samuel</em>, but whosoever it was (for we cannot determine it) it
cannot be rationally supposed that he had the Story of this transaction
betwixt <em>Saul</em> and the Woman from Divine Revelation, for
then doubtless it would not have been left so ambiguous and
doubtful, but the whole truth, both of the matter, manner and
circumstances, would in all probability have been fully set down:
and have been declared whether it were a miracle wrought by God,
a delusive apparition of Satan, the Soul of <em>Samuel</em>, or the Imposture
of the Woman, the certainty of which had been mainly profitable
and expedient for the people of God and his Church to have
known. And if the Penman had it from the relation of <em>Saul</em> or either
or both of his Servants, then it must needs have been according
to their deluded imaginations and their deceived apprehensions,
as is most rational to believe that it was; or if he had it from
the Woman, or those of her family, (which is not rationally probable)
then it is sure to have been represented for the most advantage,
and credit of the Womans skill and cunning. But the
most learned persons do judge it to be related, meerly according
to the deceived opinion and apprehension of <em>Saul</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Consid. about Witchcraft, p. 86.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. But to come more near the stress of the business, though
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> confidently say, that Mr. <em>Scots</em> Tenent, that the Woman
was in one room and <em>Saul</em> in another, when the feat was acted,
is but a pretty knack and contrivance, and but an invention without
ground, and not as much as intimated in the History: Yet we
must soberly averr, that nothing is more plain in the Text, than either
that they were in diverse rooms, or that <em>Saul</em> saw nothing at all,
but what he had was from her relation, or the acting of a confederate,
and this we shall prove by these undeniable reasons. 1. After
<em>Saul</em> had pacified the pretended fears of the Woman, who falsly
counterfeited that she knew not <em>Saul, who was taller by the head
and shoulders than any man in Israel</em>, the next thing we hear of in
the Text is, <em>and when the Woman saw Samuel</em>: Now if they were
both in the same room, and <em>Samuel</em> a visible object, how comes it
to pass that <em>Saul</em> saw him not? for if they were both in one room,
and <em>Samuel</em> visible, how is it that he did not or could not see him?
were his corporal eyes as blind, as the eyes of his understanding?
surely not. What fiction or invention must salve this? surely Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>
must pump to find it out. 2. The next thing is, that when
the Woman saw (for blind <em>Saul</em> saw nothing) <em>Samuel, she cried
with a loud voice, magna voce</em>, or (as the Hebrew hath it) <i><span lang="co">in magna
voce</span></i>. And (I pray you) if they had been both in one room, or near
together, what need she to have cried with a great voice, might
not an ordinary tone have made him to have heard her? What
was he deaf as well as blind? Or it might be it was the more to amuse
and amaze the wretched and deluded King, or to shew the
wonderfulness of the apparition she feigned that astonishment, the
more to magnifie her skill and cunning. Well, admit these were so,
yet however it is manifest, notwithstanding her great voice, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>as yet <em>Saul</em> saw nothing, but stood waiting like a drown’d Puppet
to hear what would be the issue, for all he understood was from her
cunning and lying relation. And so either thus far it is manifest
that they were in distinct rooms, or there was nothing that he
could see. 3. The next thing is, he saith, <em>be not afraid, what sawest
thou?</em> that is, though I be <em>Saul</em>, yet be not afraid, I have sworn,
and thou shalt receive no harm, but <em>what sawest thou?</em> As who
should say, I see nothing as yet at all, but I suppose thou hast seen
something; for otherwise his question doth not agree with the
words the Woman spake before. But however it is manifest that
as yet he saw nothing, and therefore rationally it must be supposed
that they were in distinct rooms, or that there was nothing visible,
that he could see. Further, his question is not in the present tense
but of the time past, <em>what sawest thou?</em> or what hast thou seen?
which could not be congruously spoken, if they had been both
in one room, but however do undeniably conclude that as yet he
saw nothing at all. 4. The next is the Womans lying and forged
answer, thereby to magnifie her own craft, and the more to amuse
and astonish poor deluded <em>Saul</em>, saying; <em>Behold I saw gods ascending
out of the earth.</em> Well, it is still apparent that as <em>Saul</em> could
not before see <em>Samuel</em>, now he neither seeth these Gods she telleth
him of, nor any such thing: So that all that he apprehended was
from her forged Stories, for he saw nothing as yet, either because
he was not in the same room with her, or that there was no visible
apparition. 5. Then he maketh another absurd question, like a
distracted Man in the house of <em>Bethlem</em>, saying, <em>what form is he of?</em>
when his question should have been, what forms are they of? for
she spoke of Gods which are plural, and more than one, but he
asketh in the singular, <em>what form is he of</em>. By all which it is manifest,
that he yet saw nothing at all. For when we plainly see a
thing, we do not usually ask others what form it is of, because our
eyes can inform us of that. So that he saw nothing, either because he
was not in the same room, or that there appeared nothing that was
visible. 6. Now after all these ambiguous lies, and delatory cheats, the
crafty quean doth begin to come more near, to give satisfaction to
the blinded expectation of <em>Saul</em>, who all this while stood gaping to
see the appearance of <em>Samuel</em>, and so she tells him (who was fit to
believe any thing, though never so absurd, or impossible) <em>behold an
old man comes up, and he is covered with a mantle</em>. In the beginning
of the action, the Text saith, <em>and when the woman saw Samuel,
she cried out</em>, then she said, <em>she saw gods ascending out of the earth</em>,
and now after all this discourse and expence of time <em>Samuel</em> is but
coming up, all was lies and delayes the more to blind and delude
the poor credulous King. But yet thus far it is plain that <em>Saul</em> saw
nothing at all, and so must needs all this while, either be in another
room, or else for certain there was no apparition visible, and
all the satisfaction that he had, was from the lying stories the Woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>told him. Now let Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> consider and answer, whether
it be not only intimated, but clearly holden forth in the Text that
either they were in two distinct rooms, or that nothing visible did
appear before <em>Saul</em>. 7. Now after all this the Text saith, <em>and
Saul perceived that it was Samuel</em>, the Hebrew word doth signifie
to know or to perceive, and relates to the understanding: but how
did he know, or perceive that it was <em>Samuel</em>? not by the sight of
his eyes, for we have made it plain that he was either in another
room, or that no visible apparition presented it self before his eyes,
but he only perceived it by the description of the crafty Woman,
who knew well enough what habit or garments <em>Samuel</em> wore in
his life time, as one that was the most publickly known Man in
<em>Israel</em>: and therefore the subtil and crafty quean, knowing that
<em>Saul</em> only required <em>Samuel</em> to be brought up and no other, doth
at the last frame her tale agreeable to <em>Sauls</em> desire, and so describes
him an old Man, covered with a mantle, and such an one <em>Saul</em> had
known him to be, while he was living. But if <em>Saul</em> had seen any
such thing as the shape or form of <em>Samuel</em>, then the Hebrew Verb
thrice used in that action, that properly signifieth to see with the
eyes, would have been used in this place (as well as when it relateth
what she saw) and not the verb for knowing or perceiving that
relateth to the mind, and <em>Samuel</em> he saw not, but only believed the
lies she told him. For otherwise it would have been, And <em>Saul</em>
saw <em>Samuel</em>, and not, <em>Saul</em> perceived that it was <em>Samuel</em>, which he
could not do but only by her relation, and forged tales. 8. The
last thing in this action, is, that <em>Saul stooped with his face to the
ground, and bowed himself</em>: now to what did he stoop and bow,
seeing he had seen nothing with his own eyes, neither knew any
thing that appeared, but as the Woman told him? Could it be to
any thing but to an imaginary <em>Samuel</em> and such an one as she had
described, whom he conceited in his Phantasie to be <em>Samuel</em> himself?
Surely in rational consequence it could be nothing else. For
all that she had done and said before, being undeniably lies and
cheats, this also in just and right reason, must be judged to be so
also. So that it was either the Woman, that being in another room,
did change and alter her voice, and so plaid the part of <em>Samuel</em>,
or else that she had a confederate knave, whom she turned out to
act the part of dead <em>Samuel</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The last thing that we shall handle concerning this controverted
subject, is the examination of the grounds and reasons of those
that are of a different judgment, which may be comprised in these
three several heads. 1. Some do conceive that it was the Body of
<em>Samuel</em> that was raised up, and acted by his soul or by Satan. 2. Some
hold that it was <em>Samuels</em> Soul that appeared in the shape and habit,
that he had living. 3. Others do positively affirm that it was the
Devil that assumed the shape of <em>Samuel</em>, and so acted the whole
business, by a compact betwixt him and the Woman. These we
shall confute in order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Philipp. 3. 21.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 27. 52, 53.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Caten. Aur. Tho. Aquin. in</em> Matth. 27.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Revel. 14. 13.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>1. That it was not the Body of <em>Samuel</em> that was raised up, nor
the Soul joyned with it, that acted <em>Samuels</em> part, is manifest from
these reasons. 1. Because <em>Samuels</em> Body had lain too long in the
grave, for some account it near two years, and therefore must needs
in a great part be corrupted, wasted and disfigured, that none could
have certainly known that it was <em>Samuel</em>. 2. It must have been so
putrified and stinking, that none could have endured near it, for
the noisome and horrible smell. 3. Who should have covered it with
the mantle, which had it been buried with him, must in so long a
time, have been rotten and consumed? Surely there were no Taylors
in the Grave, to make him a new one, but (in reason and likelihood)
if it had been his Body, it should have appeared in Linnen,
or a winding-sheet, if that had not been rotten likewise.
4. To raise a Body, so long dead, must needs have required an omnipotent
power, for it is the Almighty power of Christ alone, that
raiseth up the vile Bodies of his Saints, and maketh them like his
glorious Body. And therefore neither the woman with all her Divinations,
nor all the Devils in Hell, nor any created power, but
the Lord Almighty, could have wrought this miracle, who
would never have done it, to gratifie the humour, or to magnifie
the cheating craft of an idolatrous, wicked and couzening Witch.
And if the Devil or any created power could raise up the Body of
a departed Saint, then the rising out of the Graves of many Bodies of
Saints, that had slept, and their coming into the holy City, and
appearing unto many, after Christ was risen from the dead, had
been no certain, or convincing argument, of the undoubted truth
of the Divinity and Resurrection of our most Blessed Saviour. But they
were most infallible evidences of them both, as saith the Father
S. <em>Hierome</em> in these words, <em><span lang="la">Sic multa corpora sanctorum resurrexerunt,
ut dominum ostenderent resurgentem, &#38; tamen cum monumenta
aperta sunt, non ante resurrexerunt<a id='t172'></a> quàm resurgeret dominus, ut esset
primogenitus resurrectionis à mortuis</span></em>. 5. That it was not <em>Samuels</em>
Soul joyned with the Body, that acted this, we thus argue: That
Tenent that is flatly contrary to the plain Doctrine of the Scripture,
must needs be false. But this tenent of <em>Samuels</em> Soul acting in the
Body after death, is flatly contrary to the plain Doctrine of the Scripture,
<em>ergo</em> it is false. The major (we suppose) no Orthodox  Christian
can justly deny; and the minor is proved thus. The Scripture
doth assure us, that <em>those that die in the Lord</em> (as without all
doubt <em>Samuel</em> did) <em>are blessed, and rest from their labours</em>. Therefore
must this Tenent be abominably false: for if the Soul of <em>Samuel</em>,
after his death had been brought again to act in the Body, then he
had not rested from his labours, but had been disquieted, and
brought to new trouble, to have been vexed to have seen <em>Saul</em>
committing more wickedness than before, in taking counsel from a
cursed Idolatrous Woman, such as the Lord had commanded to be
destroyed. And there is no one point in all this transaction of <em>Saul</em>
with the Witch, that speaketh her Imposture more apparently than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>where this counterfeit <em>Samuel</em> saith, <em>Why hast thou disquieted me?</em>
As though the Saints of God after death could be disquieted by a
Devil, or a Witch, who (according to Gods infallible truth) are
blessed, and rest from their labours, and are in the hands of the
Lord, where no Torments can touch them. And therefore none
would have spoken those lying words, but a devilish cheating quean,
or a damnable suborned confederate.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. If <em>Samuels</em> Soul was again joined to his body so long after separation,
and so performed vital actions, who was the author of
this conjunction or union? could the Witch or the Devil or any
created power effect that union? Surely not, none but the almighty
power of Jehovah, who breathed into <em>Adam</em> the breath of life. And
therefore we are bold to assert (with all the company of learned
Christians) that this opinion is erroneous, impious and blasphemous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Sam. 15. 33.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Verse 29.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. The second opinion, that it was <em>Samuels</em> Soul that appeared
in his wonted shape and habit, that he wore while he lived, hath
been strenuously maintained by the Popish party, and as strongly
confuted by the reformed Divines. But we shall not trouble our
selves and our readers with them all, but only urge two or three
that are most cogent, thereby to answer Mr. <em>Glanvils</em> fopperies, and
they are these. 1. If it were <em>Samuels</em> Soul that appeared, it cannot
be supposed to come contrary, or whether God would or not,
for hardly any rational Man (we believe) will affirm that, because
God doth whatsoever he will, both in Heaven and Earth, and who
hath resisted his will? 2. And it cannot be rationally thought that
<em>Samuel</em>, who whilst he lived, was so punctually careful to do nothing
(especially in his prophetick office) but what he was commanded
of God, would after his death run an errand without his
consent or licence. 3. And that his Soul did not come by the command
of God is most certain: Though Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> ask the question,
who saith that happy departed Souls were never imployed
in any ministeries here below? To which (though we have answered
it before) we now again reply, that all learned Divines of the
reformed Churches have said, and maintained it, and so do we
both say and affirm, that they never were nor are imployed in ministeries
here below, because never created, nor ordained of God,
for any such end or purpose, but there are legions of Angels, that
are ordained to be ministring Spirits, and not the Souls of the Saints
departed this life. But Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> goeth further, and saith, that
<em>Samuel</em> was not raised by the power of the Witches inchantments,
but came on that occasion on a Divine errand. And though we
have before unanswerably proved in the general, that no Souls of
those that are dead do after death appear, or wander here below,
nor come such sleveless errands, as he supposeth: yet we shall add
one or two here in particular, to prove that <em>Samuels</em> Soul came not on
a Divine errand as sent by God, without which mission it could not
have come at all. 4. For fourthly, if Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> had proved by
any argument, or colour of reason, that his Soul had come upon such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Divine errand it had been something, but he hath only laid down an
affirmation, without either proof, reason or authority, and we may
with as good reason deny it, as he affirm it, for bare affirmations
prove nothing at all. 5. It is manifest that God in all his ordinances
of providence, especially in the order of his miracles, doth
work chiefly to confirm and witness truth, for that (as the worthy
and learned <em>Stillingfleet</em> hath observed) is the most proper <em>criterium</em>
of a miracle; and to send a Soul from the dead must needs be
miraculous. Now if the chief end in Gods working of miracles
(for none else but he can work them) be to establish truth, and
settle his own Divine and pure worship, then it cannot be to uphold
lies and Idolatrous courses. But if God should have sent <em>Samuels</em>
Soul on a Divine errand, when the Witch was practising her
Diabolical Divinations and cheating tricks, it had been to have
countenanced and confirmed both <em>Saul</em>, and the Witch, in their
wicked wayes, and to have contradicted his own law and command,
which did positively order, that all that used Divinations
should be put to death, and all those that sought for counsel from
them to be severely punished. Now let Mr. <em>Glanvil</em>, or any other
prove, that God orders that to be done by the dead, which he
forbad to be done by the living. 6. If it had been the true <em>Samuel</em>
that appeared, it is not rational, nor credible to imagine, that he
would neither rebuke <em>Saul</em> for consulting with a Woman that practised
those things, that were forbidden by the law upon pain of
death; nor that he would either reprove, or punish so wicked a
Woman, finding her in the very act. We say it is not credible, unless
we suppose <em>Samuel</em> less zealous for the law and commands of
God, being dead, than he was for them being living. Surely he
that living <em>hewed Agag in pieces</em>, only because God had commanded
he should be slain, would (if it had been the true <em>Samuel</em>, which
without all question it was not) have done as much or worse, to
the cursed and Idolatrous cheating Witch, though after his death,
if he had come upon a Divine errand. 7. God should have shewed
himself very mutable, if he had answered <em>Saul</em> in a miraculous way
by a dead Prophet, that had refused to answer him by one living.
And <em>Samuel</em> while living knew certainly that the Lord had rejected
<em>Saul</em> from being King over <em>Israel</em>, and had testified unto him, that
<em>the strength of Israel would not lie, and that he was not like a man
that he should repent</em>. But if it had been the true <em>Samuel</em> that had
been sent to speak to <em>Saul</em>, he knowing both by his own knowledge
and relation of <em>Saul</em> himself, that God had refused to answer
him by Prophets, must in that conference both have made
God a liar, and mutable, and also himself, who living had testified
the contrary, and therefore it could not be either the true <em>Samuel</em>
nor his Soul. 8. It is manifest that the Lord had before withdrawn
his good Spirit from <em>Saul</em>, and an evil one from the Lord was come
upon him, and therefore it was no way probable, that the Lord
would in a miraculous manner answer such a wicked person, whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>he had utterly rejected as a reprobate. Neither is it like that God
would shew him an extraordinary favour by a dead Prophet, that
would not vouchsafe him his Spirit in an ordinary way. And <em>Samuel</em>
that came not at him for a long time (though but a little distance
asunder) while he lived, was not like to make so long a
journey in a Divine errand to visit him after his death. 9. And if
<em>Abraham</em> at the request of the rich Man <em>would not send Lazarus
to warn his brethren, lest they should come into that place of torment</em>,
which bore with it a fair shew both of Charity and Piety;
much less would God give way (or <em>Samuel</em> be desirous to come)
to send a blessed Soul from its rest for such a frivolous matter, and
in no wise to connive at the wickedness of both <em>Saul</em> and the
Witch, and never move either of them to the amendment of their
lives. 10. Where doth Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> find it mentioned in any part
of Scripture? or where is it recorded in the writings of any reformed
or Orthodoxal Divines? or where in any of their works is
it declared, that ever any blessed Soul after death, was either sent,
or did come upon a Divine errand to any here below? Is it not
monstrous confidence (not to say impudence) to utter such groundless
assertions, without any proof, reason, or authority at all? Let all
learned and judicious persons consider and judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. That the Devil assumed the shape of <em>Samuel</em>, and acted the
whole business, is the opinion of all, or the most of the learned Divines
of the reformed Churches, of whom we shall crave pardon,
if we dissent from them, it being no fundamental of Religion, nor
any Article of the Faith. And this we profess is not done out of
the spirit of contradiction, nor for singularity, but only because
(as we conceive) the Tenent hath no sufficient grounds neither from
Scripture nor sound reason, to support it, and therefore we shall
labour its confutation, by these ensuing arguments.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Because this opinion, that the Devil should perform this apparition,
doth beg two suppositions, never yet sufficiently proved,
and that have in them no certain truth. For first they take
for an Hypothesis, that Devils are meerly and simply incorporeal
Spirits, which we shall prove hereafter to be false. Secondly they
take for another Hypothesis, that Spirits and Devils can assume
what bodies they please, and appear in any figure or shape, which
is a meer figment invented by the doating Schoolmen, as we shall
sufficiently make good hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. We are not of their opinion, that think, that the Devils do
move, and rove up and down in this elementary world at their pleasure,
to act what they list, and appear when, how and in what shapes
they please, for then the World would be full of nothing almost
but apparitions, and every corner replenished with their ludicrous
tricks, as formerly in the times of blind Popery and ignorance,
there was no discourse almost, but of Fairies, Hobgoblins, apparitions,
Spirits, Devils and Souls, ranting in every house, and playing
feats in every Town and Village, when it was nothing but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>superstitious credulity, and ignorant fancies of the people, joined
with the Impostures of the Priests and Monks. And if this were
true, then how should Men know a true natural substance or body,
from these fictitious apparitions? Nay how could a Man have
known his Father or Mother, his Brethren or Sisters, his Kinsmen
or Neighbours? might they not as well have believed them to be
Phantasms, and assumed bodies, as real and true creatures?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Kings 22.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isa. 37.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. But though faln Angels in respect of their malice, wicked
wills, and envious desires whereby they seek (as much as in them
lies) the ruine of all mankind both in Soul and Body, may in
that particular end and regard, be said to be like roaring Lions
going about and seeking whom they may devour, and compassing
the earth and walking to and fro in it: yet we must affirm
that in respect of executing their wicked, envious and malicious
wills and desires, they are restrained, nay kept in the chains
of everlasting darkness, from which fetters and chains they go not
out, but when and so far as they are sent, ordered, licensed (or as
some would have it worded) permitted, by the purpose and decree
of the Divine and Almighties providence. So that it is most
certain, that the faln Spirits cannot go forth of their chains, when
they list, to act what mischief they would, contrary to the will of
the Almighty, who hath fettered, and still keeps them in those
chains: but when they are at any time let loose, it is only by the will,
decree, licence and order of Jehovah, who sends them forth to accomplish
his will, either for punishment to the wicked to inflict
upon them his just judgments, for which they are the appointed
ministers and executioners, and in the performance of these offices
of his wrath, they are limited and bounded how far they shall proceed,
and no further; or else they are sent forth to tempt, or afflict
the godly for the trial of their faith, and herein they are so restrained
and bounded by the power of the Almighty as they cannot
act one jot beyond the limit of his commands or Commissions, as
is manifest in the case of <em>David</em>, who was tempted by Satan to
number the people, and in the affliction of <em>Job</em>, wherein he was bounded
how far he should act, and no further. And when the evil
Angels are thus sent forth, and limited by God, what, and how
far they shall act, it is always for just and righteous ends, as in the
case of <em>Ahab</em>, when a lying Spirit was sent by God into the mouths
of his Prophets, that he might be persuaded to go up to <em>Ramath
Gilead</em> that he might be slain there, or as it was for a judgment and
destruction upon <em>Sennacheribs</em> Army, that <em>Jerusalem</em> might be saved
and freed, and he sent back with shame and confusion into his own
countrey, or it is to manifest his glory, goodness and mercy to his
Saints, so <em>David</em> was moved to number the people, that falling under
that temptation, and he and the people therefore plagued,
might be brought to a greater degree of repentance, and to know
that their defence stood not in the multitude of men, but in the benignity
of Jehovah, who was their strength and their defender,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and so <em>Job</em> was so sore afflicted, that his Faith and Patience might
be made manifest, and remain for an example to all succeeding posterities.
But it is utterly irrational and incredible that God
would send the Devil (without whose mission he could not have
done it) to appear in the shape of <em>Samuel</em>, either to magnifie the skil,
or practice of a lewd, wicked, and Idolatrous Woman, which thing
he had forbidden by his plain and open law, nor to gratifie the curiosity
of a wretched Reprobate, such as was <em>Saul</em>, whom he had
denied to answer by living Prophets, and therefore would not answer
him by the apparition of a Devil, to have committed a counterfeit
Imposture, in the shape of holy <em>Samuel</em>. And therefore we
conclude, that it was no apparition of the Devil, but meerly the
Imposture of the Woman, either alone, or with a Confederate.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is also a fourth opinion concerning the transaction of this
Woman of <em>Endor</em>, that holds, that it was neither the Body, or
Soul of <em>Samuel</em> that was raised up, neither the Devil that appeared
in his shape, nor that it was the Imposture of the Witch alone, or
with a Confederate, but that it was the Sydereal, or Astral Spirit
(as they are pleased to term it) of <em>Samuel</em> that was made to appear,
and speak by the art and skill of the Woman. But because this
Tenent is not of much Antiquity, nor hath many assertors of it,
as also because it taketh that for an Hypothesis, to wit, that there
are three parts in Man, the Body, Soul, and Spirit; and that
the Soul goeth immediately after death either to Heaven or
Hell, the Body to the grave, and that the Spirit doth for a certain
time after death wander in the air, and may be (by a certain
kind of art) brought to appear visibly, and to give answers of all
things that it knew living, which as yet hath never been sufficiently
proved, therefore we shall pass it over here, having (perhaps) occasion
to speak of it more largely hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall now come to mention some places in the New Testament
that are produced by some, thereby to prove the great power of
Devils and Witches in transferring and carrying bodies in the air,
as is that of our Saviours temptation, where it is said that the Devil
took him into an exceeding high Mountain, and that he set
him upon the pinnacle of the Temple in <em>Jerusalem</em>, from whence
they thus argue: That if the Devil had power to carry our most
blessed Saviour in the air into an high mountain, and to set him
upon the pinnacle of the Temple, that much more hath he power
to carry the bodies of Witches who are his sworn vassals in the air,
whither he pleaseth, or they desire. To annul the force of which
objection we give these reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 3. 16.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 3. 22.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Judg. 15. 15.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. If it were granted that the Devil did transport our Saviour
in the air, yet it will not follow that he can at any time when he
pleaseth carry the Bodies of Men or Women so likewise, for no
particular proposition will, according to the rules of art, infer a
general or universal conclusion, nor one example or instance inductively
prove a general practice; one Swallow doth not make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Summer. For though once when our blessed Saviour was baptized,
the Holy Ghost did descend like a Dove, and light upon him, it
will not follow, that in all other of his actions of preaching, or
working of miracles, the holy Spirit should appear also in the form
of a Dove, nor when other Saints are Baptized will it follow that
it doth, or should alwaies appear in the same form. And though
<em>Samson</em> did once slay a thousand of the <em>Philistines</em> with the jawbone
of an Ass, it doth not follow, that either he did so in like
manner in every battel, or that every Man may do the like.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. If it were granted that the Devil did carry Christs Body in the
air, it will not follow that he can do so at any other times, when he
pleaseth, because in the temptation of Christ there was an extraordinary
dispensation of God for the same, which cannot be presupposed
in the ordinary transportation of Witches, and therefore
the argument falls quite to the ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. In the actions of Satan (especially in elementary things, for
we speak not of the acts of his will) the will, order and licence of
God is chiefly to be considered, because his power (in respect
of execution) is under the power of the Almighty, so that he
can do nothing in this respect but what he is ordered and commanded
to do. And therefore the end of the action is principally to
be regarded; for if God should have given way that Christ should
be carried by Satan in the air, it was for a glorious and good end,
that the obedience of his will to the Father might be shown, and
that his victory over the Devil might be made manifest: but in carrying
the Bodies of Witches in the air, there can be no good, just or
pious end wherefore the Devil should be licensed, or permitted to
carry them in the air, except it were to promote filthiness and abominable
wickedness, which were absurd and blasphemous to imagine.
And therefore we may rationally and plainly conclude, that
the carrying of the Bodies of Witches in the air, by the power of
the Devil, is a false, wicked and impious opinion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Ezek. 8. 3.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Caten. Aur. Tho. Aquin. in</em> Luke 4.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. Some are of opinion that this whole transaction was visible,
sensible and corporeal, as <em>Theophylact</em>, and many others. Some are
of opinion that it was wholly in a Vision. And some take a middle
way that it was partly sensible and visible, and partly mental,
and by way of vision. Of which opinion the great <em>Cameron</em> seems
to be, who compares it with that of <em>Ezekiel</em> who saith: <em>And the
spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me
in the visions of God to Jerusalem</em>: And sheweth that the word
<span lang="grc">Ἀνήχθη</span> doth agree with the Hebrew word <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>נשא</span>,<a id='t178'></a> which is as applicable
to lifting up or carrying in a vision, as to bodily transportation.
And that it was either altogether, or partly in a vision, the
learned <em>Beza</em> gives us this note: <i><span lang="la">Hoc videtur satis ostendere hæc omnia
per visionem quandam, non corporali transvectione &#38; ostensione
esse gesta, quomodo nempe humanitus videre potuisset omnia regna
orbis, &#38; gloriam eorum in momento?</span></i> But though it be the more
sound and rational opinion that the whole transaction was mental,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and in a vision, yet we shall not altogether stand upon that, but if
it be granted that it was corporeal and visible, yet it doth not appear
that our Saviour was in his Body carried by the power of the Devil in
the air, either to the top of an high mountain, nor set upon the pinnacle
of the Temple in <em>Jerusalem</em>, and that for these reasons. 1. Our
Saviour did not go to undertake this combat with Satan unwillingly,
that he need be constrained, or carried to try the utmost power
and malice of the Devil, but readily and willingly by the conduct
and leading of the holy Spirit, for the Text saith in <em>Matthew</em>;
<em>Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted
of the Devil</em>: And S. <em>Mark</em> saith; <em>And immediately the spirit driveth
him into the wilderness</em>. And S. <em>Luke</em> saith: <em>He was led by the
spirit into the wilderness</em>. <em>Beza</em> saith, <i><span lang="la">subductus fuit in desertum</span></i>,
and <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> saith, <i><span lang="la">ductus fuit</span></i>, upon the place in S. <em>Matthews</em>
Gospel. And in S. <em>Luke</em> <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> saith; <i><span lang="la">Et duxit eum spiritus in
desertum</span></i>, and <em>Beza</em>, <i><span lang="la">actus est ab eodem spiritu in desertum</span></i>. And in
S. <em>Mark</em> <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> saith, <i><span lang="la">deduxit eum spiritus in desertum</span></i>, and
<em>Beza</em> rendreth it, <i><span lang="la">expellit eum spiritus in desertum</span></i>. And because
of the Greek word which is there <span lang="grc">ἐκβάλλει</span>, he addeth this note, <i><span lang="la">Non
significatur expulsio violenta, sed vis divina, quæ Christum, (qui
ad illud usq; tempus ut privatus vixerat) nova persona induit, ac
luctæ proximæ &#38; ministerio præparatur</span></i>. Therefore saith <em>Origen</em>:
<i><span lang="la">Sequebatur planè quasi athleta ad tentationem sponte proficiscens, &#38;
quodammodo loquebatur: Duc quo vis, &#38; invenies me in omnibus
fortiorem</span></i>. So that it is most plain that he was no otherwise led or
carried by Satan, but as he was led by the Holy Ghost, so that he
went whithersoever Satan would desire him of his own mind and
accord, and needed not to be carried by the Devil, for S. <em>Luke</em> useth
the same Greek word both for the Holy Spirit leading of him,
and Satans leading of him, so that Satan did not carry his body in
the air, as Men vainly conceive. 2. Though S. <em>Matthew</em> use the
word <span lang="grc">παραλαμβάνει</span>, which may signifie <i><span lang="la">assumpsit</span></i>, he took him, and
set him upon a pinnacle of the Temple, and took him into an high
mountain; yet it cannot be understood thereby that he took him,
and carried his Body, but that he went before, and led Christ to
those places, that he thought most fit for him to prevail in his temptations,
to which places Christ went not by an unwilling constraint
or hurried and carried in the air, but by a ready willingness, as
one that certainly knew, and was assured, that he should win the
Victory where ever, or how great soever the combat and temptations
were. And therefore S. <em>Luke</em> useth the same word from
<span lang="grc">ἄγω</span>, <em>duco</em>, both for the Spirits, and Satans leading, as signifying no
more, but to go before, and lead the way, or to draw one to such
or such a place by persuasion and desire, and not to be carried in the
air, which appeareth to be a vain and forged interpretation, and
not the true meaning of the places.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Acts 8. 9.</div>

<p class='c008'>Concerning <em>Simon Magus</em> we have before in this Treatise sufficiently
proved that he was only a deceiver and Impostor, and what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>strange feats he had done to astonish, and stupifie the <em>Samaritanes</em>,
were only jugling knacks, or deceits by confederacy, and no supernatural
things, so that here we will say no more, but only add:
That though our English translation say that he bewitched the people
of <em>Samaria</em> with sorceries, and that he himself, when he beheld
the miracles and signs that were done, wondered; yet the
word that they translate in the one place bewitching, and in the other
wondered, are both from one <em>Thema</em> which is <span lang="grc">Ἠξίστημι</span>, <i><span lang="la">de statu
mentis dejicio, facio ut aliquis mente non constet, perterrefacio, obstupefacio</span></i>.
And therefore either it ought to be that the <em>Samaritanes</em>
were astonisht at the feats that <em>Simon</em> wrought, and that he
himself was astonisht at the miracles of <em>Philip</em>, or that they were
both bewitched, for they were both under the same amazement,
and there is no reason at all to give it one sense in one place, and a
different one in the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>We need not here say any thing of <em>Elymas</em> who is stiled a Magician,
because it is manifest that he was a false Prophet, full of all subtilty,
and all mischief, a Child of the Devil, and an enemy of all righteousness:
which character truly given to him by the unerring sentence
of S. <em>Paul</em>, may be really ascribed to the whole tribe and profession
of such kind of seducers and deceivers. Like unto whom
were those <em>seven Sons of Sceva a Jew</em>, who are called <em>exorcists</em>, that
<em>took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits, the name of
the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth</em>,
but were soundly beaten for their pains, a fit reward for such
vagabonds; And if all that profess or practise such wicked, vain
and lying things were duely punished, the poor ignorant people
would not be so much abused as they are.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other places in the New Testament we have handled, and answered,
and also have touched upon that Text in the <em>Galathians</em>
where we spoke of Fascination, but lest it be not sufficient, we shall
handle it fully here. The words are, <em>O foolish Galathians, who
hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth?</em> From
whence they use thus to argue: If Witchcraft in the Apostles time
had not been known, and practised, he would not have made use
of that Phrase then; concerning which we return these responsions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Delrio.</em> <em>l.</em> 3. <em>q.</em> 4. <em>sect.</em> 1. <em>Concl.</em> 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. If we consider natural Fascination was by the Philosophers
and Poets only taken to be contagious steams flowing from the eyes,
or breaths of malevolent and envious persons, that had some infectious
diseases, as we see in the Plague, Small-pox, <em>Lues Venerea</em>,
soreness of Eyes, Tinea’s, and the like, which are contagious to others
that lie with them, or converse near them, the infected atomes
or steams issuing in a certain Sphear of activity, are received by the
pores, or mouths of the sound persons, by which they come to be
infected also. And this the Poet witnessed: <i><span lang="la">Nescio quis teneros
oculus mihi fascinat agnos</span></i>. Now this being the common opinion,
the Apostle taketh the metaphor from thence, as who should say,
who with their virulent and poysonous opinions have infected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>you, that you should not obey the truth. And this is the genuine
meaning of that metaphorical phrase, and no other sense can rationally
and congruously be put upon the place, and this conduceth
nothing to that opinion of Witchcraft that we oppose. For <i><span lang="la">Philosophica
seu Physica fascinatio non nisi impropriè dici potest fascinatio,
propriè verò est contagio, seu infectio</span></i>. And therefore did the learned
<em>Vallesius</em> to the same purpose speak this. <i><span lang="la">Sed neq; si quis pestilenti
affectus febri, aut etiam sine febre deferens secum seminaria
pestis alium intuens intuentem inficiat, dicetur fascinasse, sed peste
affecisse.</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Jo. Lazar. Guttier. de fascino.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Some of the fathers (which may be offered for an objection)
do seem to hold that S. <em>Paul</em> here meant of diabolical fascination,
and so <em>Tertullian</em> in English thus: For there is also something amongst
the Gentiles to be feared, which they call fascination, being
a more unfortunate event of praise, and great glory: this we
sometimes interpret of the Devil. And S. <em>Hierome</em> saith upon this
place: Fascination is when some things by Magical illusions are
shewed to the eyes of Men, otherwise than they are. Also Fascination
is vulgarly called that, which doth hurt Children, for the
eyes of certain persons are said to burn with looking, and this act of
theirs is called Fascination, and it may be that the Devils are subservient
to this Sin. And <em>Thomas Aquinas</em> saith: And this also may
be done by Devils, who have power of moving false imaginations,
and bringing them to the principles of the Senses, by changing the
Senses themselves. From whence we may note these things. 1. That
<em>Tertullian</em> saith that they sometimes interpret this of the Devil, but
how truly or upon what grounds he sheweth not, and it seemeth
that sometimes they did interpret it of something else, for so his
words must needs imply. 2. Secondly, S. <em>Hierome</em> sometime calleth
fascination Magical illusions, and sometime that which doth hurt
Children, by the burning of some eyes; and then comes in with a
may be that the Devils are subservient to this sin. So that he is not
certain in his opinion, nor truly knows what fascination is, but
according to vulgar opinion, or blind conjectures. 3. And all that
the Angelical Doctor saith, doth but amount to the delusion of the
Senses, by false imaginations, so that here is no proof either of the
Devil, or his instruments, to cause any real fascination.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Guttier. passim.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Galen. de Incantat.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Those that hold that <em>Paul</em> did allude unto natural, or diabolick
fascination, do but mean magical illusions, whereby the senses
are abused and deceived, to take things to be that which really
they are not, and so are but cheating Incantations and delusory
Juglings, for as <em>Galen</em> (if that piece be truly his) saith: <i><span lang="la">Incantationes
verba sunt decipientia rationales animas secundum spei inceptionem,
aut secundum timoris incisionem</span></i>. So that though S. <em>Paul</em>
had taken the metaphor from that which was commonly accounted
fascination, there is no necessity, that therefore the metaphor must
in all points be true: it is sufficient that the common opinion was
so, from whose usage of such terms the Apostle useth the word,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to fascinate, or inchant. And of this opinion was S. <em>Hierome</em> himself
who saith thus much: <i><span lang="la">Dignè Paulum, qui etsi imperitus est sermone
non tamen &#38; scientia, debemus exponere non quod scierit esse
fascinum, qui vulgò putatur nocere, sed usus sermone sit trivii, &#38;
ut in cætero, ita &#38; in hoc quoq; loco verbum quotidianæ sermocinationis
assumpserit</span></i>. So that from hence it is most evident, that the
using of the word fascination by the Apostle, doth not inferr the
being of the thing, but only the opinion of the vulgar, that believed
things that were not. And of the same judgment is <em>Thomas
Aquinas</em> in these words: <i><span lang="la">Propriè dicit Apostolus, quis vos fascinavit?
quasi dicat, vos estis sicut homo ludificatus qui res manifestas
aliter accipit quàm sint in rei veritate</span></i>. Therefore we shall conclude
this point with the sentiment of S. <em>Hierome</em>: <i><span lang="la">Nunc illud in causa
est, quod ex opinione vulgi sumptum putamus exemplum, ut quomodo
tenera ætas noceri dicitur fascino, sic etiam Galatæ in Christi
fide nuper nati, &#38; nutriti lacte, &#38; solido cibo velut quodam fascinante
sunt nociti</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Galen</em> <em>l.</em> 8. <i><span lang="la">de compos. medic.</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>4. But howsoever fascination might be understood, yet it is
plain, that except the <em>Effluvia</em> or steams of Bodies that had contagious
diseases, entring into other sound Bodies, and thereby infecting
them with their noysome vapours, or Atomes, there is nothing,
but what was vain belief and credulous superstition, as the
learned <em>Vallesius</em> tells us in these words, thus rendered in English:
“But if this be the way or reason of fascination, any one may easily
understand, that fascination is a certain superstitious fear, arising
from foolish credulity, of which sort are many other things in the
life of Man, as for argument, that this opinion is more approved
of by Women than by Men, and far more of the unlearned than of
the learned. Although (he saith) I also see that there are those
amongst the learned that are rather lovers of subtilty than verity,
who take care to defend those things that the vulgar do admire. By
which they would be accounted judicious magical Juglers, and
Men skilful of secrets.” And therefore he thus concludeth: “Therefore
the name of fascination is ancient, and according to the ancient
signification, it doth not signifie any natural disease, but a
vain superstition, arising from vulgar opinion, and therefore neither
<em>Hippocrates</em>, nor <em>Galen</em>, nor any of the ancient Physicians,
that I know of do mention fascination, neither amongst the differences
nor causes of Diseases. From whence again is taken
no small argument of its vanity.” Therefore we shall conclude this
point with that remarkable saying of <em>Galen</em>. “<i><span lang="la">Falsæ etenim opiniones
animas hominum præoccupantes, non solum surdos, sed &#38; cæcos faciunt,
ita ut videre nequeant, quæ aliis conspicua apparent.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The Angelical Doctor with the consent of the most part of all
the learned do affirm that the Devil by his own power cannot
change corporeal matter, unless he apply proportionate actives to fit
passives, to produce those effects he intendeth; As for instance,
he can cause burning, because there is a combustive agent in nature;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>but if that were awanting, or if there were no combustible matter,
how should he cause any ignition? But if he be supposed to work
diabolical fascination, for which there is no agent in nature, it being
but an imaginary thing in the heads of the deluded vulgar;
then it will necessarily follow, that he can work no fascination at
all, and so the whole opinion of the Witchmongers falls to the
ground. For it is manifest that there is contagion, by the infected
<em>Effluvia</em> or steams issuing from a diseased Body to another by which
it may be contaminated, but otherwise there is no natural fascination,
nor any agent in nature to produce that effect, and therefore
there can be no Diabolical fascination at all.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><em>Of Divine permission, providence and prescience.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>There is no one thing that hath more promoted this false and
wicked Tenent of a kind of omnipotency in Devils, and the
exorbitant power ascribed to Witches, than the misunderstanding
of the true and right Doctrine of Divine Providence, and the admitting
of a bare permission in God as different and distinct from
his providence. From whence it cometh to pass that not only the
vulgar, but such as tread in the steps of <em>Arminius</em>, do hold a meer
bare permission, and that God sits as a quiet beholder by his Prescience
from the event of things to see what will be effected by Devils
and wicked Men, who in the mean time run and rove about, acting
what, when and how they please, and that God hath neither hook
in their nostrils, nor bridle in their mouths, neither keeps them in
any restraint, order or government, and so we must needs have a
mad rule in this World, during this permission and naked inspection.</p>

<p class='c008'>But that we may proceed in such order, as may be clear and intelligible
to the Readers, we shall here propose the state of the matter
that we undertake to confute, which is this: That there is not
in God a nude, passive permission, separate from the positive and
active decree, order and will of his Divine Providence and Government,
but that he doth rule all things according to the power
and determination of his own positive and actual will. And this
we shall prosecute in this following order and particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those that deny that there is in God a passive permission separate
from his decretive and actual will in his providence are accused by
others, thereby to infer the absurdity, that God is the author or
efficient cause of sin; which pretended absurdity, in truth and reason
cannot be any, because it is a simple and absolute impossibility, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>God should be the author of sin as these arguments do sufficiently
testifie.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>James 1. 13.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Psal. 5. 4.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Deut. 32. 3.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. That of necessity must be false, which the Scriptures do declare
to be so, in open and plain terms. But that God should be
the author of sin or evil, the Scriptures do deny in open and plain
terms, as where the Text saith: <em>God cannot be tempted with evil</em>:
where both the act, and the possibility of it is absolutely denied.
Again: <em>For thou art not a God that hast pleasure in wickedness, neither
shall evil dwell with thee</em>. Therefore it is false that God is, or
can be the author of sin; and so by consequence the supposed absurdity
is a meer impossibility; and an absurdity urged that is impossible,
is most of all absurd.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. He is <i><span lang="la">ens summè perfectum, &#38; quicquid est in Deo, est Deus</span></i>;
but sin howsoever understood, or accepted, is an imperfection,
defect and an aberration from a just and perfect rule, and therefore
it is simply impossible that God can be the cause of any thing
that is imperfect, sinful or evil, if sin be considered as <i><span lang="la">malum
culpæ</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 3.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 4. 15.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. God is not under any binding law given to him by some other,
for then he should cease to be supream, independent and omnipotent:
Now to whom there is no law given to observe, there can be no
transgression, for the Apostle saith, <em>where there is no law, there is no
transgression</em>; and therefore it is simply impossible that God should
be the author, or causer of sin, or evil, because there is no law
that he can transgress against.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Civitat. Dei</span></i>, <em>l.</em> 2. <em>c.</em> 7.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. God prohibiteth and hateth sin, as the Scriptures do every
where testifie, but God is the cause of nothing but that which he
loveth, and therefore cannot be the cause of the evil of sin. And
to speak properly sin hath no efficient cause, but a deficient, such
as is the will of faln Angels, and wicked Men, whose irregularity of
will, from the command of God, is all the cause that sin and evil
hath or can have. An efficient cause is only of those things that are
good, because every efficient cause doth by working put something
in being: But privations (of which sort are sins) do put nothing
in being, but do truly note the absence of beings. Therefore did
S. <em>Augustine</em> say well: <i><span lang="la">Mali causa efficiens nulla est, sed tantùm deficiens</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>John 8. 44.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 John 3. 8.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. That which properly hath an efficient cause, hath also an end
properly so called: But sin hath not an end properly so called, because
the end is being, and therefore good, and the perfection of
the thing. But the Scripture doth declare that <em>all things that God
created were exceeding good</em>; and that the cause of sin was Man, and
the Devil; for the text saith, that <em>the Devil was a murderer from
the beginning, and abode not in the truth</em>: And again, <em>He that committeth
sin, is of the Devil, for the Devil sinneth from the beginning</em>.
Therefore from hence it is clear, that God neither is nor can be the
author or causer of sin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Fulgent.</em> <em>lib.</em> 1. <i><span lang="la">ad Monim</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>6. That which God is the author of, doth not make Man worse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>but sin doth make Man worse, therefore God is not the author of
it. And all sin is perpetrated, because thereby it receeded from the
order that respecteth God, as the ultimate end of all things; but
God doth incline all things unto himself, as to the ultimate end,
neither doth he turn them from himself, because he is <i><span lang="la">summum bonum</span></i>.
And further as <em>Fulgentius</em> saith: <i><span lang="la">Deus non est ejus rei autor,
cujus est ultor. At Deus est peccati ultor, ergo non autor.</span></i> And
therefore we conclude, that this is a vain pretence of an absurdity,
because it is impossible that God should be the author or causer of
sin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Job 13. 7.</div>

<p class='c008'>This plausible pretence to seem to be zealous, not to make God
the author of sin, we commend as allowable; but it is but like the
zeal of the Scribes and Pharisees, which was without knowledge,
because they pretend that for an absurdity, that is a simple impossibility.
And they ought to remember the argument of <em>Job</em>, which
is this: <em>will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for
him?</em> For as we ought not to suppose, or imply him to be the author
of sin; so we ought not to rob him of his Glory, by detracting
from his power and providence, nor in ascribing that unto Creatures,
that is only due unto the Creator; as those do that hold a nude
passive permission in him separate from his will and decree in his
providence. Neither doth the denying of this any way imply that
he is the author of sin, for a providential permission we allow as the
act of his will and decree, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now concerning permission in God, being a suspension of his
efficiency in regard of some acts permitted to the creatures, and
that for just and good ends, the definition of it and its affections or
properties are so darkly handled even by those that make most ado
about it, that it would serve rather to divert Men from the right
way than to guide them in it, or unto it. Therefore here we shall
only note these three things, and pursue it more fully hereafter.
1. There must be the person or power permitting that hath ability,
right and authority so to do. 2. There must be the person or power
permitted that hath ability to perform the thing permitted, otherwise
it would be in vain, and to no purpose. 3. There must
be the thing or action that is permitted to be done, or brought to
pass, by the person permitted to act, and that must not be impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Before the Creation it is meerly improper to attribute permission
unto God, because there was no person, nor power besides himself
that could act any thing, and therefore could not be permitted,
and so the correlative being awanting, both the relative and the relation
betwixt them must necessarily fall to the ground, as having
no existence; and so it is impossible that permission should be in God
when there was no Creature to be permitted, and so could not be
attributed unto him before the Creation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Caus. Dei</span></i>, <em>p.</em> 171.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. It is as improper to attribute permission unto God in respect
of the Physical agency of second causes, because he not only worketh
all in all, and by his Divine concourse and conservative power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span><em>sustaineth all things by the word of his power</em>, and <em>Job</em> tells us: <em>If
he gather unto himself his spirit and breath, all flesh shall perish together,
and man shall turn again into dust</em>. Upon which place of the
<em>Hebrews</em> S. <em>Chrysostome</em> saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Feratq; inquit omnia, hoc est,
gubernet omnia. Siquidem cadentia, &#38; ad nihilum tendentia continet.
Non enim minus est continere mundum quàm fecisse: Sed si
oportet aliquid quod admireris dicere, adhuc amplius est. Nam in
faciendo quidem, ex nullis extantibus rerum essentiæ productæ sunt:
in continendo verò, ea quæ facta sunt, ne ad nihilum redeant continentur.
Hæc ergo dum reguntur, &#38; ad invicem sibi repugnantia
coaptantur, magnum &#38; valdè mirabile, plurimæq; virtutis judicium
declaratur</span></i>: But also because he hath set all natural things their
bounds, and ordered, decreed and determined their ends in acting.
Now what he hath appointed, ordered and decreed to be the agency
of every creature, and determinated its end in acting, cannot
properly be called permission, but his will, ordination and providence.
As if one should say he suffereth and permitteth the Sun
and Moon to run their course, it is an improper expression and injurious
to his wisdom and power in his providential government of
the creatures, seeing that it is a certain truth, <i><span lang="la">Deus operatur in
omni operante</span></i>: And <em>he hath appointed the Moon for seasons, and the
sun knoweth his going down</em>. And it is absurd to say he suffereth
the Sea to Ebb and Flow, when he hath <em>set it a bound that it
cannot pass over. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
which lifteth up the waves thereof. And said, hitherto shalt thou
come and no further: And here shall thy proud waves be staid.</em> And
again, <em>Will ye not tremble at my presence saith the Lord, which have
placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree that it
cannot pass it, and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can
they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it</em>. And
therefore we may conclude that the whole Creation in respect of
Physical agency is ruled according to those orders, and not by a
fortuitous chance, or a bare passive permission. 1. For first all
creatures have their Physical agency, and the affections and properties
thereof ordained by God in the Creation, and according to
this they constantly act, except they be turned, altered, or suspended
by the Creator himself, and he doth immediately act in them
all, and they cannot properly be said to be permitted. 2. They
are upholden, sustained and conserved in their several conditions,
by the word of his mighty power, his continual concourse and divine
emanation, which if it should but cease one minute, the whole
Creation would fall into that nothing, from whence his Eternal and
Omnipotent <em>Fiat</em> did raise and call them forth, so that we dare affirm
with profound <em>Bradwardine</em>, <i><span lang="la">Quod necesse est Deum servare quamlibet
Creaturam immediatiùs quacunq; causa creata</span></i>. 3. When he pleaseth
he doth suspend the effects and agency of natural causes, as in making
the Sun stand still in the victory of <em>Joshua</em>, and of the three Children
in the fiery Furnace. Sometimes he causeth them to act contrary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>their innate powers and qualities, as in <em>making the shaddow go ten
degrees back in Ahaz sun-dial</em>: and in causing <em>the waters of the red
sea</em>, contrary to their natures, which are to tend downwards, <em>to
be divided, and to go backward, and to be as a wall on the right
hand, and on the left, until Moses, and the children of Israel were
passed through.</em> And by many other wayes and means doth he alter
and change the course of natural agents, to serve his will and
good pleasure in his mercy, or in his justice, and yet here is no bare
or passive permission. 4. Besides these he ordereth all the particular
acts of natural agents, to be subservient unto his will: So when
<em>Jonah</em> fled to <em>Tarshish</em>, <em>the Lord sent forth a great wind into the sea,
and raised a mighty tempest to overtake Jonah</em>; and when he was
cast into the Sea, <em>the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow him up,
and also the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited up Jonah upon
the dry land</em>. Now the wind was not carried nor the storm
raised, by a permissive power, but by the will and order of the
Lord Jehovah, who sent them, and directed them either by his immediate
power, or by the ministry of his Angels; and though they
wrought according to their natural agency, yet the special ordering
as to the particular act was not by permission, but by the will and
appointment of his providence. Neither did the great fish come by
chance or permission, but God in his merciful providence had prepared
him for the preservation of <em>Jonah</em>, and caused him to be vomited
on the dry land; so that all creatures do not only continue
according to his ordinances, but also all elementary, and irrational
creatures do praise the Lord by fulfilling his word, will and
providence. And lest we be either censured to wrest the Scriptures,
or to be single in this opinion, take the judgment of some few others.
S. <em>Gregory</em> (as he is quoted by learned <em>Bradwardine</em>) tells
us thus much: <i><span lang="la">Quis de Deo ista vel desipiens suspicetur, qui nimirùm
dum sit semper omnipotens, sic intendit omnibus, ut assit singulis;
sic adest singulis, ut simul omnibus nunquam desit; sic itaq;
exteriora circundat, ut interiora impleat; sic interiora implet, ut
exteriora circundet; sic summa regit, ut ima non deserat; sic imis
præsens est, ut à superioribus non recedat</span></i>. And <em>Thomas Aquinas</em>
their great Schoolman (as the same author cites him) saith: <i><span lang="la">Quòd
Deus immediatè ordinat omnes effectus per seipsum, licet per causas
medias exequatur, sed in ipsâ executione quodammodò immediatè
se habet ad omnes effectus, in quantum omnes causæ mediæ agunt in
virtute causæ primæ, ut quodammodo ipse in omnibus agere videatur,
&#38; omnia opera secundarum causarum ei possunt attribui, sicut artifici
attribuitur opus instrumenti</span></i>. Therefore we will conclude this
with that of S. <em>Augustine</em>: <i><span lang="la">Proculdubio nullus est locùs ab ejus præsentia
absens; super omnem creaturam quippè præsidet regendo, subtus
est omnia sustinendo, non pondere laboris, sed infatigabili virtute,
quoniam nulla creatura ab eo condita per se subsistere valet, nisi
ab illo sustentetur, qui eam creavit. Extra omnia est, sed non exclusus,
intra omnia, sed non conclusus.</span></i> And these places need no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>fiction of an Hebraism to expound them, nor no device of a verb
of an active termination, and a permissive signification to evade the
pressure of this truth. And therefore in respect of Physical agency
we are bold with <em>Bradwardine</em> to assert these three Corollaries.</p>

relate to intellectual and rational creatures, and that only and
especially in respect of those actions which we call moral, that is, in
regard of sin, evil or <i><span lang="la">malum culpæ</span></i>; for whatsoever is <i><span lang="la">malum pœnæ</span></i>,
God is the author, causer and inflicter of, according to the Text:
<em>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</em> To understand
aright the nature of permission, we are to consider the
affections, properties and adjuncts of it, both in regard of the
person permitting, the creature permitted to act, and the thing
permitted to be done, with all the circumstances about them, and
these we shall take from their Ring-leader and great Champion <em>Arminius</em>
himself in these points.</p>

that he know, what, to whom, and the ability of performance,
that is to be granted, or used, by the person permitted, and
that the person permitting have power to permit and to impede,
and also that he have the right and authority of permitting. 2. In
the person permitted, it is necessarily requisite, that he have sufficient
power to effect and perform the thing permitted, if not hindered;
for otherwise it would be nonsense to say, that a person is
permitted to do an act that he hath no power to perform. 3. If the
person permitted have sufficiency of power to perform the act permitted,
yet there is also required a propension and disposition in
the person permitted, to perform the thing permitted, otherwise
the permission as to that act would be without a certain end, and
so would be <i><span lang="la">in vagum</span></i>, inconstant and not to be performed, and
therefore he concludeth thus: <i><span lang="la">Imò nec rectè dici potest quod alicui
actus permittatur, qui actus illos præstandi affectu nullo tenetur</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. We shall omit the exceptions that the learned and subtile
Dr. <em>Twisse</em> hath made against diverse particulars in these passages,
and shall only fix upon one that is manifestly false (if he mean of
permission in general which he confesseth.) For in the Angels and
<em>Adam</em> before their falling and committing of sin, there was not any
propension or disposition to sin, and therefore to this we shall give
the most acute answer of Dr. <em>Twisse</em> in these words: <i><span lang="la">Nam licèt insit
homini propensio ad peccandum (scilicet post lapsum) per modum
dispositionis, quæ præcedanea sit permissioni actus peccaminosi; At
in Adamo (ante lapsum) nulla inerat hujusmodi dispositio, aut ad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>peccandum propensio, ante peccatum ejus primum. Sed neq; in Angelis,
qui à statu suo ceciderunt. Secundo, ut ut dispositio, sive habitus
insit qui inclinet ad agendum, non est ex natura dispositionis
sive habitus cujuscunq; ut faciat hominem propendere ad actum aliquem
particularem, cujus vel solius ratione dicitur permissio.</span></i> And
though it be granted that God did create the Angels, and <i><span lang="co">Adam
in statu labili</span></i>, wherein they had a sufficiency of power or grace not
to have sinned, or faln, and though that power or grace was not
withdrawn from them, and that there was no coaction upon their
wills to inforce them to sin; for if it had been so, their falls would
have been no sin: so neither did God supply them with more assisting
grace to have upholden them, for then their estate had not been
labile, nor they in a possibility to sin. But it is manifest that they
in their Creation were set in <em>æquilibrio</em>, and had equal power of
freedom of will either to sin or not to sin, and so had no propension
or disposition at all to commit that sin, to which they were left
by a free permission: and so propension and disposition to the act
permitted (if permission be understood generally) had no place in
the Angels nor <em>Adam</em> before their first sinning, according to the Text,
<em>God made man upright</em>, that is like a straight or right line that falling
perpendicularly upon another right line, doth incline to neither
end of the line upon which it falls, so <em>Adam</em> was made upright
without any propension or inclination to sin at all. And if this
propension and disposition be understood, and applied to Angels
in their condition after their fall, then it is true they have not only
an inclination but a most strong will and desire to commit more
evil and mischief than God in his goodness permits them to perform,
for <em>the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lion seeking whom
he may devour</em>, and it was Satan that not only had a disposition,
but <em>desired to sift Peter as wheat</em>. And it is manifest that wicked
Men have a strong will and desire to commit mischief; but that
God hath an hook in their Nostrils, and a Bridle in their Jawes
wherewith he curbs and restrains them, that they cannot act out
all the mischief that they intend, as is manifest in the example of
<em>Sennacherib</em> and many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Permission must be referred and reduced to the will of God,
for nolition is an act of his will as well as volition: and to speak
properly and truly, permission is but an act of the Divine Will not
to impede such or such particular actions of the creatures; and therefore
the same things will follow from his volition or his will <i><span lang="la">non
impediendi</span></i>, as from his volition to the acts of a free agent, seeing
neither do put coaction upon the will of the Creature that is to act.
And that permission is an act of the Divine will, and to be reduced
unto it <em>Arminius</em> confesseth in these words: <i><span lang="la">Permissionem ad genus
actionis pertinere ex ipsa vocis flexione est notum, sive per se sive reductive,
ut in Scholis loquuntur. Cessatio enim ab actu, ad actum
quoq; est reducenda: causam autem proximam &#38; immediatam habet
voluntatem, non scientiam, non potentiam, non potestatem, licet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>&#38; ista in permittente requirantur.</span></i> And when he defineth permission,
he saith: <i><span lang="la">Permissio Dei, est actus voluntatis Divinæ</span></i>; than which
nothing can be more clear. And not much different from this is the
definition of permission, that is given by learned <em>Junius</em> thus: <i><span lang="la">Est
autem permissio actus voluntatis, quo is penes quem est alienas actiones
inhibere, eas non inhibet, sed agentis voluntati permittit earum
modum</span></i>. And again he saith: <i><span lang="la">Apud Deum verò Opt. Max. nulla
est omnino permissio, nisi voluntaria: quandoquidem omnis divina
permissio à principio interno est, id est, à voluntate ipsius, &#38;
movetur ad finem quem voluntas præfinivit ejus</span></i>. But we will conclude
this with that of S. <em>Augustin</em> thus Englished: “Not any thing
cometh to pass, unless the Omnipotent will have it to be done, either
that it may be done by his suffering, or by his Volition. Neither
is it to be doubted that God doth well, even by suffering
those things to be done, that are done evilly; For he doth not
permit but by a just judgment, and verily every thing is good
that is just. Although therefore those things that are evil, in as
much as they are evil, they are not good; notwithstanding, as
they are not only good, but also as they are evil, it is good. For
unless this were good that there should be evils, they would by
no means be permitted of the omnipotent good, to whom without
all doubt it is always as easy to do that which he would, as
it is easy not to suffer that which he would not have to be.” By
all which it is plain that his permission is the act of his Divine Will,
and if he would not have it done he would not permit it, and so
the same consequences will follow from Nolition, that follow from
Volition, in respect as they are both acts of the Divine Will.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Twisse ut supra.</em> 346.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Prov. 16. 4.</div>

<p class='c008'>8. It is a certain truth that all moral actions are performed by a
physical power in respect of the sustentation of the will in its natural
being while it acteth, and that the creature is conserved even
in the act as it is natural, though there be obliquity in the will of
the creature acting in reference to the law given, or made known
unto it. And this <em>Arminius</em> acknowledgeth in these words: <i><span lang="la">Necesse
itaq; est, ut cum Deus potentiæ creaturæ actum aliquem permittit,
creatura illa conservetur, ut sit, &#38; vivat, potentia ejusdem
permaneat, idonea ad actum producendum, nulla major vel æqualis
potentia opponatur, objectum deniq; offeratur, &#38; potentia permittatur</span></i>.
From whence therefore to instance in the first sin of the Angels
and <em>Adam</em>, besides the equal power and liberty of will that
they had to sin or not to sin, it is manifest that God willed and determined
not to withdraw his conservative power from them, but
that they might be and live in the very act of their sinning. Neither
did he withdraw that power they had, nor opposed a greater, or
equal power to impede them, much less did he create or infuse any
evil into their natures, nor put upon them any coaction of will,
to inforce them to sin, but solely left them to the power and liberty
of their own free wills. And though by his prescience he certainly
knew that they would sin and fall, yet he determined in his purpose
not to hinder them, but by his providential decree did set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>down how to guide and order that fall and defection the most advantagiously
for his glory both in his Mercy and Justice. So that
even in this there was no bare passive permission, separate and distinct
from his will and decree in his providence, but only permission
to the moral act of their wills, which by his wisdom, decree
and providence, he ordered for his own glory, according to the
Text: <em>The Lord hath made</em> (or wrought) <em>all things for himself,
yea, even the wicked for the day of evil</em>. The Hebrew word <em>hath
wrought</em>, doth properly signifie, to work by polishing, trimming, or
framing and fitting, so that the wicked (who have made themselves
so by the acts of their own wills) God by his decree and providence
doth polish, fit and order for the setting forth of his own glory in
framing the wicked for the day of evil, the evil of punishment and
judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Further it is necessary that the creature acting a moral act (especially
in this case of the Angels and <em>Adam</em> before their fall) have
the liberty and freedom of will, and that the will at the instant of
the act, be not restrained nor under a coactive power, for otherwise
<i><span lang="la">malum culpæ</span></i> or sin would cease to be evil, and so there could
be no sin at all. And thus far, and in this peculiar respect only,
the Angels and <em>Adam</em> before their acting of sin, and in the very instant
of the act it self, were permitted, that is, God willed and
determined not to impede them, but for the ordering of that sin
and fall, the permission was conjoined with his will and providence,
and not separate from it, or a nude permission.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 7. 8, 11.</div>

<p class='c008'>10. That <i><span lang="la">malum culpæ</span></i>, or sin doth arise by the occasion of a
law; for where no law is, there can be no sin, and therefore the Apostle
saith: <em>But sin taking occasion by the Commandment, wrought in
me all manner of concupiscence</em>. So that sin considered as it is sin, is
an Aberration or Deviation of the Will of the creature from the
revealed law of the Creator, and hath simply and absolutely no other
causality, but only the deficiency and <span lang="grc">ἀταξία</span> of the Creature
to produce it, especially in these cases of the Angels and <em>Adam</em> in
their first acts of sin.</p>

<p class='c008'>11. Now we will come to the application of this unto wicked
Men as they are under original and actual sins, and that in these few
examples. 1. It is not by a bare permissive power, but by his will
and order in his providence, for he <em>setteth up the wicked in slippery
places</em>, and <em>yet a little while and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be</em>. So <em>Cain</em> was
suffered to slay his Brother <em>Abel</em>, but by and by he was sent from the
presence of the Lord into the land of <em>Nod</em>: So he set up <em>Saul</em> to be
<em>King</em> over <em>Israel</em>, and soon after rejected him, and also destroyed
him: these were by providence, not only bare permission. 2. <em>For
promotion cometh neither from the East nor the West, nor from the
South: But God is the judge, he pulleth down one, and setteth up
another.</em> So wicked <em>Haman</em> was set up to be the highest in the Kingdom
next <em>Ahasuerus</em>, and got a decree to have all the Jewes put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>to death, and had set up a pair of Gallows to hang <em>Mordecai</em> upon,
and yet see the providence of God, who quickly brought him to
be hanged upon them himself: and this will be further made out
where we speak of providence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Resp. Fludan. ad Lanov.</em> <em>p.</em> 18.</div>

<p class='c008'>12. Though those that ascribe so large a power unto Devils and
Witches, do take it for granted that they are only under a bare
passive permission, and that the faln Angels do act, what, when,
where and how they list, yet is it a meer falsity, for they are under
the rule of Gods Divine Will, decree and providence, and do act
nothing, but as and so far as they are licensed, ordered and limited
by his will and providence, and are under a punctual restraint,
nay kept in the chains of everlasting darkness unto the judgment
of the great day, as we shall prove at full in that Chapter
where we handle the knowledge and power of faln Angels. And
therefore here we shall only say this, that if Devils could do as much
mischief as they would, and were under no restraint or chains, then
none of the godly would be left alive. But it is manifest that Devils
do act nothing (excepting the obliquity and evil of their own
wills) but meerly as instruments of the Divine Will and Providence,
for as the Christian Philosopher saith: <i><span lang="la">Illa est impietas; nimirum
ea falso attribuere creaturis, quæ radicaliter Deo soli sunt
propria, &#38; inter cætera, actum aliquem peculiarem in diabolo esse

<p class='c008'>Concerning Divine prescience, which is as S. <em>Gregory</em> saith, <i><span lang="la">Præscientia
est unamquamq; rem antequam veniat, videre, &#38; id quod
futurum est priusquam præsens sit prævidere</span></i>, we may only note this,
That it is certain and infallible, as saith the Lord by the Prophet:
<em>Behold the former things are come to paß, and new things do I declare,
before they spring forth I tell you of them</em>: Also, <em>known unto
God are all his works from the foundation of the World</em>. “So
that his prescience is that infallible vision, by which he comprehendeth
all what he knows by one eternal, immutable and ineffable
vision.” But this prescience in God doth not flow from the things
that are to come to pass, but from his decree, by which all future
things are determined, who doth <em>all things according to the counsel
of his own will</em>, for <em>God is in heaven, he hath done whatsoever he
pleased</em>. But this prescience is not to be considered only by it self,
as a bare vision, or inspection, but as it is coupled and joined with
his providence, <em>For the Lord looketh from heaven, he beholdeth all
the sons of men. From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all
the inhabitants of the earth. Forming</em> (or framing) likewise <em>their
hearts, and considering all their works</em>. And this prescience considered
solely by it self, is not the cause of the things that come to
pass, for as the Father saith well: <i><span lang="la">Sicut tu memoria tuâ non cogis
facta esse quæ præterierunt, sic Deus præscientia suâ non cogit facienda
quæ sunt futura</span></i>. So that we conclude that God by a naked prescience
doth not only behold infallibly the things that are to come, and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>is only a spectator of what Devils and wicked Men will do, but also
that he doth order, rule and predesign all their works and actions.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. As touching Gods Government and Administration of the
World by his Divine providence, we shall in the first place lay down
some of the definitions of it from the most sound and learned Divines
of the Reformed Churches, and that in English, after this order.
The acute and learned <em>Rivet</em> describes it thus: “Providence
is an ineffable force and virtue of the Divine Sapience and Potency,
by which God doth conserve and govern to his own Glory
all his Works according to his eternal, most wise, and most
free decree, and directing every thing in time unto its end.” <em>Johannes
de Spina</em> defines it thus: “Providence is the prescience and
counsel of God eternal, most free, immutable, most just, most
wise; most good, whereby God worketh and determineth all good
things in all, but doth only permit evil things, and doth dispose
and direct all things to his own Glory and the Salvation of his elect.”
And much to the same purpose doth <em>Lambertus Danæus</em> speak in
these words: “Providence is a most free and most powerful action
of God, by which he not only stirreth up and governeth universals,
but also singulars, in every one of their single actions. And
(he saith) it is called a most free and most powerful act, because
it can neither be hindered nor overcome by any law.” And to
these for substance do agree <em>Calvin</em>, <em>Musculus</em>, <em>Beza</em>, <em>Zanchius</em>, and
the rest of all Orthodox Divines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Exeges. Loc.</em> 6. <em>p.</em> 143, 144. <em>&#38;c.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. But we shall chiefly insist on that definition that is given by learned
<i><span lang="la">Piscator</span></i> in these words: “The providence of God is his
eternal, most wise, most just and immutable counsel or decree,
whereby he doth most freely govern all things by him created to
the glory of himself, and the Salvation of his elect.” To which he
giveth this explication: “That it doth consist of a Genus and
three differences. The Genus is the word <i><span lang="la">Decretum</span></i> which is
illustrated by four adjuncts; Eternity, Sapience, Justice and Immutability.
The first difference is taken from the objects; which
are all created things. The second from the ends, which are two,
the Glory of God, and the Salvation of the elect. The third from
the effect, which is the government of things created, which Gubernation
is illustrated by the adjunct which is liberty.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 9. 15, 18.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Job 34. 13.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. The parts of this definition are thus proved. 1. That the
providence of God is his counsel and decree, appeareth most plainly
from these Scriptures: <em>Peter</em> in his Sermon to the Jews upon the day
of Pentecost saith: <em>Him</em> (that was Jesus) <em>being delivered by the
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God</em> (<span lang="grc">τῇ ὡρισμένῃ βουλῇ καὶ προγνώσει
Θεοῦ</span>)<a id='t193'></a> <em>ye have taken, and by wicked hand have crucified and
slain</em>. And again the Church at <em>Jerusalem</em> in their prayers say thus:
<em>Of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou hast anointed, both
Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and people of Israel
were gathered together, For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>determined</em> (<span lang="grc">ἡ χείρ σου καὶ ἡ βουλή σου προώρισε γενέσθα</span>) <em>before to be done</em>.
2. That all things created (nay also those things which do seem to
happen fortuitously, or to be by permission, as sinful actions) are governed
and ordered by the providence of God, as these Scriptures
will sufficiently demonstrate. <em>Christ Jesus the son of God, doth uphold</em>
(or sustain) <em>all things by the word of his power</em>. And doth not
our Saviour tell us: <em>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing, and
one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father? But the
very hairs of your heads are all numbred. Fear ye not therefore, ye
are of more value than many sparrows.</em> That place concerning the
Cities of refuge, and the fleeing of the ignorant man-slayer thither
is most remarkable, and is this. <em>And this is the case of the slayer,
which shall flee thither, that he may live: whoso killeth his neighbour
ignorantly, whom he hated not in times past, as when a man
goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand
fetcheth a stroak with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slipeth
from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die, he
shall flee unto one of those Cities, and live.</em> And was not the action
of <em>Josephs</em> brethren, sin and sinful in selling of him to the Ismaelites,
and yet he acknowledgeth, <em>that God sent him before them to preserve
life</em>. So that God brought good forth of evil, and doth order
even the sins of the wicked to just and good ends by his Divine
Providence. Again: <em>The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole
disposing thereof is of the Lord</em>. So when the Men in the Ship with
<em>Jonah</em> did cast lots, by the Lords disposing <em>the lot fell upon Jonah</em>
who was justly guilty, and so by providence pointed out. 3. That
God doth govern all things to his own glory is manifest by these
Texts: <em>The Lord hath made all things for himself; yea even the
wicked for the day of evil</em>. And, <em>what if God, willing to show his
wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long suffering
the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: And that he might
make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which
he had afore prepared unto glory?</em> And that he governeth all things
for the Salvation of his elect, is plain: <em>And we know that all things
work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the
called according to his purpose</em>. So that if God be for the Elect,
who can be against them? 4. That God doth govern all things
most freely is clear, because he is omnipotent and supream, and
there is no power that can either impede, or constrain him, <em>For he
hath done whatsoever he would, both in Heaven and Earth</em>. And
the Apostle saith; <em>I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy.
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom
he will he hardeneth.</em> For <em>who hath given him a charge over the
earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</em></p>

<p class='c008'>4. The several ways that God useth in governing the creatures
in the world whether good or bad, may be comprised in these four
ways. 1. He ruleth and ordereth them, by bending, inclining and
turning of their wills and intentions, to serve and fullfil his decree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>and pleasure. So when the Brethren of <em>Joseph</em> were fully resolved
to murther him, God by the means of <em>Reuben</em> and <em>Judah</em>, so wrought
upon their minds and wills, that they were contented to sell him
to the Ismaelites, that so the determinate counsel of God might be
fulfilled; for though they intended it for evil, that he might never
return to his Father, nor to have his dream fulfilled that they might
bow down before him, yet God intended it for good, and so
brought it to pass. And this he did not by changing or taking away
their natures, nor by putting a coactive power upon their
wills; but by inclining and bending them to his own purpose, so
that the act was the act of their own wills, but the moving of their
wills to spare his life was from the Lord: for as he that made the
eye must needs see, so he that made the will must needs have a power
to move, incline and turn it. And therefore the Father said
well, <i><span lang="la">Certum est, nos velle cum velimus, sed Deus facit, ut velimus
bonum</span></i>. And it is apparent that the hearts of all men are in the hands
of the Lord, and he turneth and inclineth them according to his
will and purpose, as saith <em>Solomon</em>, <em>The Kings heart is in the hand
of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he
will</em>. Upon which the note of <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> and <em>Junius</em> is this: <i><span lang="la">Est
quidem animus omnium hominum gubernaculum, quo velut naves in
mediis aquis reguntur corpora &#38; actiones nostræ: tamen ne ipsorum
quidem regum animus ex seipso permovetur, impellitur, inhibeturque,
sed Deus in singulorum animis, veluti clavum tenet</span></i>. And concerning
the wicked God saith: <em>I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and
multiply my signes and wonders in the land of Ægypt</em>. And again:
And <em>indeed for this cause, have I raised</em> (made thee stand, <i><span lang="la">feci ut existeres</span></i>,
as <em>Beza</em> notes) <em>thee up, for to shew in thee my power, and
that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. And as yet
exaltest thou thy self against my people, that thou wilt not let them
go?</em> And further the Text saith: <em>He turned their hearts, to hate his
people, to deal subtilly with his servants</em>. 2. God also ruleth and
ordereth his creatures by leading, drawing, inciting and moving
their wills to his own ends and purposes, as sometimes to good,
as in his own people: <em>For as many as are led by the spirit of God,
they are the sons of God</em>. And so was our Saviour <em>led</em>, or driven
(<span lang="grc">ἐκβάλλει, ἤγετο, ἀνήχθη</span>) <em>into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil</em>.
To this agreeth the blessing and prophecie of <em>Noah</em>: <em>God shall perswade</em>,
or allure <em>Japhet</em>, <em>to dwell in the tents of Shem</em>. Sometimes
God inciteth the creatures to evil by the ministery of Satan, as is
manifest in these examples. For the Text saith, <em>And again the anger
of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against
them, to say, Go number Israel and Judah</em>. And another place
saith: <em>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
the people</em>. Whereby it is plain that Satan was the instrument,
as sent and ordered of God to move <em>David</em> to number the people,
that thereby the King and people might be punished, and the King
thereby brought to a deeper sight of his sins, repentance, and a closer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>trusting and adhering to his God. So when the Lord intended to
have <em>Ahab</em> to go up to <em>Ramoth Gilead</em> that he might be slain, he
sent forth an evil Angel, to be a lying spirit in all <em>Ahabs</em> Prophets,
and said unto him, <em>Thou shalt perswade him, and prevail also: Go
forth and do so</em>. So that what God orders, Satan doth but execute.
So when God intended to punish and destroy <em>Abimelech</em>, and the
Men of <em>Shechem</em>, he sent an evil spirit between them to divide them,
and so accomplisht his will upon both parties, as saith the Text:
<em>Thus God rendred the wickedness of Abimelech which he did unto
his father, in slaying his seventy brethren. And all the evil of the
men of Shechem, did God render upon their heads: and upon them
came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</em> 3. God ruleth his
creatures by permission, or his will of not impeding them to act
according to their wills and power, as in these cases. For God
speaking of his people of <em>Israel</em> saith: <em>But my people would not hearken
unto my voice; and Israel would none of me. So I gave them up
unto their own hearts lusts, and they walked in their own counsels.</em>
Agreeable to which is that in the <em>Acts</em>: <em>Who in times past suffered
all nations to walk in their own ways</em>: which is as <em>Beza</em> notes: <i><span lang="la">Ex
arbitrio suo vivere, nulla ipsis præscripta ratione religionis</span></i>. And
in this sense, and to this purpose it is that <em>God gave</em> (<span lang="grc">παρέδωκεν</span>) <em>them
up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts</em>; because of
that horrible Idolatry that formerly they were guilty of. 4. God
ruleth his creatures by his providence, sometimes by repressing,
prohibiting and impeding the execution of their wicked wills, as
is clear in the case of <em>Abimelech</em> King of <em>Gerar</em>, who took <em>Sarah</em>
<em>Abrahams</em> Wife intending to have had carnal knowledge of her,
but God plagued him and his Family, and said; <em>For I also withheld
thee from sinning against me; therefore I suffered thee not to
touch her</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now we shall come to consider how the faln Angels are under
the rule and restraint of this Divine and all-governing providence,
wherein we shall make it appear, that they act nothing in this elementary
and sublunary World, after any corporeal manner, but as
they are ordered, licensed and limited by the will and decree of the
Almighty, and so do not wander and rove at their own pleasures to
act in corporeal things, what, when and how they list, as the Witchmongers
vainly suppose, and this we shall clear in these particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It cannot rationally be supposed that God is less wise, in ruling
and ordering the Prince of darkness, the Prince of Devils, and
the head of all Rebellion and Rebels, than he is in ruling his Subjects
and Servants, which are all wicked men; but all these he ruleth
with a rod of Iron, and breaketh them in sunder like a Potters
vessel: And therefore much more hath he a restraint upon, and a
rule over the faln Angels who kept not their first estates, and therefore
are reserved in chains in darkness until the judgment of the
great day.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 25. 41.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 8. 31.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>2. As he is the Prince and Ring-leader of all Sin and Rebellion
against God, though he yet have not his final punishment, unto
which he is reserved for the judgment of the great day, and
though he be not yet thrust into the abysse or great depth, nor into
that everlasting fire that is prepared for him and his Angels; yet
is he kept in chains and darkness, and can act nothing but as he is
licensed, ordered and limited by the Almighty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Thom. Aquin. Caten. aur. in Luc.</em> 8. <em>p.</em> 200.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. And though he compass the earth to and fro, and walk about
<em>like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour</em>, yet is that but according
to the malice and purpose of his wicked will, for in punishing
or afflicting of the godly he must have licence from God first,
or else he can do nothing in this Elementary World, as is most manifest
in the affliction of <em>Job</em>, neither could he enter into the herd
of Swine, but by Christs leave and order, nor deceive <em>Ahabs</em> Prophets
but by order from the Lord. And therefore an ancient Father
said well: <i><span lang="la">Quod si super porcos potestatem non habent, multò
magis nullam habent Dæmones contra homines factos ad imaginem
Dei; oportet ergo Deum solum timere, contemnere autem illos</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore we shall conclude this briefly here, having occasion to
handle it more fully hereafter, to wit, that the Witchmongers can
have no shelter for their opinion from the Doctrine of Gods permission
(if rightly understood) because God doth neither order,
nor permit faln Angels to act any thing (especially in corporeal things)
but what is for just, good, and wise ends, which cannot be shewed
in these actions attributed to Witches.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Whether faln Angels be Corporeal or simply Incorporeal, and

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>I am not insensible what great censure I may incurr for entring
upon such a ticklish and nice point as the corporeity or incorporeity
of Angels, seeing it hath exercised and crucified the wits
of the most learned in all ages, especially being but an obscure person,
and not heightned with those lofty titles that usually elevate
Mens fames, more by those attributes than by the weight and
strength of their arguments. Yet it being no necessary Article of
the Christian Faith, but that a Man may lawfully defend either, it
cannot rationally be judged by understanding Readers either to be
pride or just offence for me to handle this subject. For seeing that
most of the Christian and Learned Fathers for the space of four hundred
years after Christ, were of the opinion that they were corporeal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>it can be no novelty in me to revive or assert that opinion, and
therefore I shall labour to make it manifest in this ensuing order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The immort. of the Soul, p. 7, 8.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Nov. Organ.</em> <em>lib.</em> 1. <em>p.</em> 49.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>p.</em> 21.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. There is a late way of arguing taken up by Dr. <em>Moore</em> and others,
that they will undertake to prove a thing to be so or so, or
else to make Man to deny his own faculties. And so the said Doctor
doth undertake to prove the existence of immaterial and incorporeal
beings, or else he thinketh he bringeth Men to deny their own
faculties: And these faculties he maketh to be, common notions,
external sense, and evident and undeniable deductions of reason.
And concludeth that, what is not consonant to all or some of these
is meer fancy, and is of no moment for the evincing of truth or falshood,
by either its vigour or perplexiveness. But this will not accomplish
the business he intends, for these reasons. 1. Because there
is not the common notion of a spiritual and immaterial being in all
or any Man, neither is it (to use his own words) true at first sight
to all men in their wits upon a clear perception of the terms, without
any further discourse or reasoning, but is only a bare supposition
without any proof or evidence at all. 2. The being of an
immaterial and spiritual substance can no way incurr into the senses
nor affect them, because it is manifest (as <em>Des Cartes</em> hath sufficiently
proved) that all sensation is procured by corporeal contact, and
not otherwise. And though we deny not that there have been, are
and may be apparitions, that cannot be rationally supposed to be the
ordinary <em>Phænomena</em> of corporeal matter, yet affecting the senses, there
must be something in them that performeth that effect, that is corporeal, or
else the senses could not be wrought upon, for <i><span lang="la">immateriale non
agit in materiale, nisi eminenter ut Deus</span></i>. 3. No right deductions can
possibly be drawn from the highest power of ratiocination, where the
understanding hath no cognoscibility of the things that reason would
draw its conclusions from, for as the same Doctor frameth his Axiome
which is this: Whatsoever things are in themselves, they are nothing
to us, but so far forth as they become known to our faculties or cognitive
powers. But we assert (which we shall make good anon) that our
faculties or cognitive powers (how far soever some would vainly
magnifie and extol them) have not the power of understanding beings
that are simply and absolutely immaterial and incorporeal.
4. There is nothing that is more undoubtedly true than what the
Lord <em>Verulam</em> hath told us in these words: <i><span lang="la">Causa vero &#38; radix ferè
omnium malorum in scientiis ea una est: quod dum mentis humanæ
vires falso miramur &#38; extollimus, vera ejus auxilia non quæramus</span></i>.
And again: <i><span lang="la">Subtilitas naturæ subtilitatem sensûs &#38; intellectûs multis
partibus superat</span></i>, the which may be proved from many undeniable
instances, which need not here be mentioned, only we shall
add what the aforesaid learned Lord speaks to the same purpose
which is this: “The fault of sense is twofold: For it either forsaketh
or deceiveth us. For first there are many things that escape
the sense, though rightly disposed, and no way impeded either
by the subtilty of the whole body or by the minuteness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>parts, or by the distance of place, or tardity and velocity of motion,
or by the familiarity of the object, or by reason of other causes.
Neither again, where the sense doth apprehend the thing, are
those apprehensions sufficiently firm. For the testimony and information
of sense is always from the Analogie of Man, not from the
Analogie of the Universe.” And it is altogether asserted with great
error, that sense is the measure of things. Neither can these notions
the Doctor would make so clear, be had or gathered, without some
intimation from some of the senses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>An Antidot. &#38;c.</em> <em>p.</em> 12.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Immortal.</em> <em>p.</em> 21.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Further the Doctor tells us that the Idea of a Spirit is as easie
a notion, as of any other substance whatsoever. And he also saith:
“Nevertheless I shall not at all stick to affirm, that his Idea or notion
(speaking of God) is as easy as any notion else whatsoever, and
that we may know as much of him as of any thing else in the
World.” This later he speaketh concerning God. But that these
assertions are unsound, these following reasons will sufficiently evince.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. He doth define a Spirit thus: A Spirit is a substance penetrable
and indiscerpible. Now if it be true that he affirms before, that, “the
subject, or naked essence, or substance of a thing is utterly unconceiveable
to any of our faculties, and that if we take away aptitudes,
operations, properties and modifications from a subject,
that then the conception vanisheth into nothing, but into the Idea
of a meer undiversificated substance, so that one substance is not
then distinguishable from another, but only from accidents or
modes, to which properly belongs no subsistence.” So then if
we take away penetrability and indiscerpibility, which are but the
modes and properties of a Spirit, whose genus he maketh substance
to be, then it vanisheth into an indistinguishable notion, and so his
definition comes to nothing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. For if substances be known by their properties and modifications,
as we grant they are, the modifications and properties must
of necessity be some ways known unto us: but there are no ways
either by common notions, evidence of the senses, or sound deductions
of reason that can certainly inform us of these properties or
modifications of penetrability and indiscerpibility, and the Doctor
yet never proved either; but is only a bare supposition, and a melancholy
figment.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 3.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Immort. p. 68.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Inject.</span></i> <em>p.</em> 598.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Natur. Subst. Energ.</span></i> <em>p.</em> 406.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. He tells us that all substance has dimensions, that is, length,
breadth and depth, but all has not impenetrability, and boldly
saith: It is not the Characteristical of a body to have dimensions,
but to be impenetrable; to which we answer. It is strongly asserted
by learned <em>Helmont</em>, that by the ultimate strength of nature, bodies
do sometimes penetrate themselves and one another, and to that
purpose he giveth convincing examples, and concludeth thus from
them. <i><span lang="la">Invenio equidem, naturæ contiguam dimensionum penetrationem,
licet non ordinariam. And after saith thus: Quibus constat
corpora solida, satis magna, penetrasse stomachum, intestina, uterum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>omentum, abdomen, pleuram, vesicam, membranas inquam, tanti
vulneris impatientes. Id est, absq; vulnere cultros per istas membranas
transmissos. Quod æquivalet penetrationi dimensionum, factæ
in natura, absq; ope Diaboli.</span></i> And to the same purpose that most
acute person, Dr. <em>Glisson</em>, handling this very point saith: <i><span lang="la">Verum
enimverò, si sola quantitas actualis sit causa impenetrabilitatis corporum
(ut ex supra dictis liquet,) eaq; sit naturaliter mutabilis;
quid impedit ne substantia materialis aliam substantiam, mutatâ
quantitate, novâq; simul assumptâ utrisq; communi, penetret?</span></i> And
therefore we may as confidently deny his assumption, that Impenetrability
is the Characteristical of body, as he affirm it without
proof, and must with all the whole company of the learned, assign
Extension to be the true and Genuine Character of Body. And
further he granting that substance hath length, breadth, and depth,
we must of necessity conclude, that whatsoever hath those properties
must needs be material and corporeal, and so that which he would
make to be Spirit is meerly Body.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Nov. organ.</em> <em>p.</em> 18.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. Whereas he saith that the notion of Spirit is as easy a notion,
as any other whatsoever, it is granted, but is not at all to the purpose:
for our inquiry need not be of the facility of a notion, but of
the verity of it, that is, of the congruity and adequation of the notion
and the thing from whence it is taken; otherwise though the
notion be easy, yet without an adequate congruity to the thing it
is meerly false. As for instance, when a melancholy person doth
verily imagine himself to be changed into a Wolf or Dog, it is not
only an easy notion, but also it is truly a notion, and yet a false notion,
because there is no true congruity betwixt it and the thing
from whence it is taken, the Body of the person so conceiving,
being not at all changed into Wolf or Dog, but still retaining its
humane shape and figure. And therefore the Lord <em>Verulam</em> doth to
this point speak truly and clearly in these words: <i><span lang="la">Itaq; si notiones
ipsæ mentis (quæ verborum quasi anima sunt, &#38; totius hujusmodi
structuræ ac fabricæ basis) malè ac temere à rebus abstractæ, &#38; vagæ,
nec satis definitæ &#38; circumscriptæ, deniq; multis modis vitiosæ
fuerint, omnia ruunt.</span></i> And therefore the Doctor might very well
have considered, whether these his new notions had been fitly and
rightly drawn from the things, to which he doth so confidently
affix them, before he had so boldly asserted them, which though
they be truly his notions, that is, that he did think, conceive, and
frame them, yet they are not truly abstracted from the things: And
so he may be rather judged to be led by speculative and Philosophick
Enthusiasm, than by the clear light of a sound understanding.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 5.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Job 11. 12.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Kings 8. 27.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. And concerning his Tenent that the Idea or Notion of God is
as easy as the notion of any thing else whatsoever, that the notion
may be easy we grant; but whether it be true and adequate, there
lies the question. For those old Hereticks that held that God had
Eyes, Ears, Head, Hands and Feet and the like, had an easie notion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>of it, conceiving him to have humane members, but I hope the Doctor
will not say that this notion of theirs was a notion truly drawn
from the nature and being of God, because there is no corporeity
in him at all. And it is and hath been the Tenent of all Orthodox
Divines, Ancient, Middle and Modern, that God in his own nature
and being is infinite and incomprehensible, and therefore there can
no true and adequate notion of him, as being so, be duly and rightly
gathered in the understanding of creatures; and so the Doctors
position or notion must needs be Phantastry and imaginary Enthusiasm.
For as there are many things in nature that in themselves
are finite and comprehensible, that as he grants of naked essence or
substance are utterly unconceivable to any of our faculties; much
more must the being of God that is infinite and incomprehensible,
which are attributes that are incommunicable, be utterly unconceivable
to any of our faculties. And it is but the vain pride of
Mans Head and Heart, thereby to magnifie his own abilities, whereas
the Text doth pronounce this of him, <em>For vain man would be
wise; though he be born like a wild ass colt</em>; that lifts him up to
conceit that he can fathom and comprehend the Infinite and Almighty,
whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain, and therefore
cannot frame a true notion of him, whom perfectly he doth not
understand nor comprehend, and the attributes of God are matters
of Faith and not the weak deductions of humane reason.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Origin. sacr.</em> <em>l.</em> 2. <em>c.</em> 8. <em>p.</em> 233, 234.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. Those that seem to idolize humane abilities and carnal reason,
have not only applied those so much magnified Engines to the discovery
of created things, wherein they have effected so little, that
sufficiently proclaims the invalidity of the instruments or the inauspicious
application of them, or both, all the several sorts of Natural
Philosophy hitherto found out, or used, being examined, coming
far short of solving the <em>Phænomena</em> of nature, when even the
least animal or vegetable affords matter enough to puzzle and <em>nonplus</em>
the greatest Philosopher, so that we may justly complain with
<em>Seneca</em>, that the greatest part of those things we know are the least
part of those things we know not; These engines (I say) though
proving ineffectual to find out the true notions and knowledge of
natural things, have also (like the fiction of the Gyants) notwithstanding
invaded Heaven, and taken upon them to discover and determine
of Celestials, wherein it is in a manner totally blind, or sees
but with an Owl-like vision. For indeed the deciding of this
point must be taken from the Divine authority of the Scriptures,
and the clear deductions that may be drawn from thence; for this
is that clear light, that we ought to follow, and not the Dark-lanthorn
of Mans blind, frail and weak reason, for it is <em>a sure word of
Prophecie whereunto</em> it is good <em>to take heed</em>, and not to <em>vain Philosophy,
old Wives Fables, or opposition of Sciences falsly so called</em>.
And therefore we shall conclude this point here concerning
the corporeity or incorporeity of Angels with that Christian and
learned position of Dr. <em>Stillingfleet</em> in these words: “But although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Christianity be a Religion which comes in the highest way of credibility
to the minds of Men, although we are not bound to believe
any thing but what we have sufficient reason to make it appear
that it is revealed by God, yet that any thing should be
questioned whether it be of Divine revelation, meerly because
our reason is to seek, as to the full and adequate conception of it,
is a most absurd and unreasonable pretence.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 2. 7.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Eccles. 3. 21.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. In handling this point of the corporeity or incorporeity of
Angels, we do here once for all exclude and except forth of our
discourse and arguments the humane and rational Soul as not at all
to be comprised in these limits, and that especially for these reasons.
1. Because the humane Soul had a peculiar kind of Creation
differing from the Creation of other things, as appeareth in the
words of the Text. <em>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of
the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
became a living soul.</em> Upon which the note of <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> and <em>Junius</em>
is, <i><span lang="la">anima verò hominis spiritale quiddam est, &#38; divinum</span></i>. 2. Because
I find <em>Solomon</em> the wisest of Men making this question: <em>who
knoweth the spirit of man, that goeth upward: and the spirit of the
beast, that goeth downward to the earth?</em> 3. Because it is safer to
believe the nature of the Soul to be according to the Analogy of
Faith, and the concurrent opinion of the learned, than to sift such
a deep question by our weak understanding and reason. So having
premised these things, and left this as a general exception and caution,
we shall proceed to the matter intended in this order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>John 4. 24.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Cor. 3. 17.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. We lay it down for a most certain and granted truth, that
God simply and absolutely is only a most simple spirit, in whom
there is no corporeity or composition at all, and what other things
soever that are called or accounted spirits are but so in a relative
and respective consideration, and not in a simple and absolute acceptation.
And this is the unanimous Tenent of the Fathers,
Schoolmen and all other Orthodox Divines, agreeing with the
plain and clear words of the Scripture, as, <em>God is a spirit, and they
that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth</em>. And again:
<em>Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord
is there is liberty</em>. Therefore we shall lay down this following proposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. That Angels being created substances, are not simply and absolutely
incorporeal, but if they be by any called or accounted spirits,
it can but be in a relative and respective sense, but that really
and truly they are corporeal. And this we shall labour to make good
not only by shewing the absurdities of that opinion of their being
simply spiritual, but in laying open the unintelligibility of that opinion,
and by answering the most material objections.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. And first to begin at the lowest step, Body is a thing that affecteth
the senses most plainly and feelingly; for though many bodies
are so pure, as the air, æther, steams of the Loadstone, and many
other steams of bodies, that they escape the sight of our eyes, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>are they either manifest to our feeling, or otherwise made manifest
by some sensible effect, operation, or the like; yet for all this, the
intrinsick nature of body as such is utterly unknown unto us, for
when we speak of the extension of body, as its Characteristical property,
we do but conceive of its superficial dimensions, its internal
nature <i><span lang="la">quatenus Corpus</span></i>, being utterly unknown unto us; it being a
certain truth, that <i><span lang="la">Quidditates rerum, non sunt cognoscibiles</span></i>; and as
D<sup>r</sup> <em>Moore</em> granteth, the naked essence or substance of a thing is utterly
unconceiveable to any of our faculties. From whence we argue,
<i><span lang="co">à minori ad majus</span></i>, that if the substance of a body, whose affections
and modifications do fully incur into, and work upon our
senses, be utterly unconceiveable to any of our senses, much more
of necessity must the substance of a Created spirit, conceived as immaterial
and incorporeal, be utterly unconceiveable to any of our
faculties, because it hath no effects, operations, or modifications
that can or do operate upon our senses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. And as we know not the intrinsick nature of body, so also
we are ignorant of the highest degree of the purity and spiritualness
of bodies, nor do we know where they end, and therefore
cannot tell where to fix the beginning of a meer spiritual and immaterial
being. For there are of Created bodies in the Universe,
so great a diversity, and of so many sorts and degrees of purity and
fineness, one exceeding another, that we cannot assign which of
them cometh nearest to incorporeity, or the nature of spirit. And
many of these being compared with other more gross and palpable
bodies, may be and are called and accounted spirits, though notwithstanding
they be all Corporeal, and but under a gradual difference.
So the vital part in the bodies of men are by Physicians called
Spirits in relation to the bones, ligaments, musculous flesh and
the like; nay even in respect of the blood, lymphatick humor,
lacteal juyce, or the <i><span lang="la">succus nutritius nervosus</span></i>, and yet still are contained
within the limits of body, and are as really Corporeal as
any of the rest, and so are the air and æther. And those visible species
of other bodies that are carried in the air and represented unto
our Eyes, by which we distinguish the shape, colour, site and similitude
of one body from another, though by the Schools passed
over with that sleight title of qualities, as though they were either
simply nothing, or incorporeal things, are notwithstanding really
Corporeal, else they could not incur into, nor affect the visive
sensories: And these do in the air intersect and pass through one
another (as may be optically demonstrated) without Confusion,
Commixion, or discerpsion, and may comparatively be accounted
spirital and incorporeal, though really they be not so. But what
shall we say to that wonderful body, Image or <i><span lang="la">Idolum</span></i> of our selves,
and other things that we behold in a mirrour or looking-glass? must
this be a meer nothing, or an absolute incorporeal thing? surely not.
For it is as really a body as any in the Universe, though of the
greatest purity and fineness of any that we know; and how near it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>approaches to the nature of spirit, is very difficult (if not impossible)
to determine; for if it did exist when the body or subject
from whence it floweth were removed, it might rationally be taken
for a Spirit, and with far more probable ground than many things
else that have been vainly supposed to be Spirits. And that these visible
shapes of things, and this Image in the glass, are not meerly
imaginary nothings, but Corporeal Figures and steams, is most manifest,
because they vanish when the body or subject is removed, because
that <i><span lang="la">nullius entis nulla est operatio, &#38; Incorporeum non incurrit
in sensus</span></i>, and because they would pass through the glass, but
only for the foil or <i><span lang="la">Bractea</span></i> laid on the otherside, by which the
Image is reflected. So that if we have bodies of so great purity,
and near approach unto the nature of spirit, we cannot tell where
spirit must begin, because we know not where the purest bodies
end.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. D<sup>r</sup> <em>Moore</em> maketh substance to be the genus, and spirit and body
to be the two species, so that body and spirit are of one generical
Identity, and so there must of necessity some certain specific
difference betwixt them be assigned and proved, or else the division
is vitious, and the property of spirit not proved, and so their opinion
of spirit falls totally to the ground. For we affirm (and shall
prove) that though a difference be imagined and supposed, yet it
was never yet sufficiently proved, for <i><span lang="la">omnia supposita, non sunt
vera</span></i>, otherwise all the impossible figments and vain <em>Chimæras</em> of
melancholy and doting persons might pass for true Oracles: but it
is one thing truly to understand, and another thing to imagine and
fancy what indeed is not, nor ever was. And though the supposition
seem never so probable and like, yet it will but at the best infer
the possibility of such an imagined difference, but not prove it
really to be so, and therefore here we shall retort the Doctors Axiom
against him, which is this: “Whatsoever is unknown to us, or is
known but as meerly possible, is not to move us or determine us
any way, or make us undetermined; but we are to rest in the present
light and plain determination of our own faculties.” Now
that a spirit is penetrable and indiscerpible, may be imagined as
possible to the fancies of some, but cannot be clearly intelligible
to any sober mind; for to imagine, and to understand, are faculties
that are very different, and however if such a difference be conceived
as possible (which cannot enter the narrow gate of my Intellect)
yet the difference of being penetrable and indiscerpible, is not
to move us to determine that a spirit hath those distinct properties
from bodies, because they are but known to us as meerly possible.
And therefore that these two differences of penetrability and indiscerpibility
assigned by D<sup>r</sup> <em>Moore</em>, are not sufficiently proved to be
so, we shall give these reasons. 1. If bodies in the ultimate act
of nature can penetrate themselves and one another, as Helmont
and D<sup>r</sup> <em>Glisson</em> do strongly labour to prove, then penetrability is not
the proper difference of spirit from body, because then common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>to them both. 2. But if it be taken for a truth (and the one of
necessity must be true) that bodies do not, or can possibly penetrate
themselves or one another, as the common tenent holdeth, and
seemeth most agreeable to verity, for it is simply unintelligible and
impossible to conceive, that two Cubes (suppose of Marble or
Metal) should penetrate one another, and yet but to have the dimensions
of one, and to possess no greater space than the one did
formerly fill: And if this be impossible and unintelligible in respect
of bodies, whose properties, aptitudes, affections and modifications
are apparent to our senses, then must it be more impossible and
unintelligible in substances supposed to be meerly incorporeal, because
they must needs be more pure and perfect, and therefore less
subject to such unconceiveable affections; and however, it can be
no wayes known to our faculties or cognitive powers, that they
have any such specifical property or affection. 3. As it is not any
way manifest to any of our senses, nor can be proved by any sound
deductions of reason, so it cannot be manifested to be any innate notion
shining from the Intellect it self, and we ought not to take adventitious
ones instead of those that are innate, nor fictitious ones
for either, but to make a due distinction of each of them one from
another. 4. Neither is indiscerpibility a proper difference of a
spiritual substance from a corporeal one, because the visible species
of things do in the air intersect one another, and suffer not discerpibility:
and that these are bodies is manifest, because they affect
the senses; and therefore that which is a property of some bodies
cannot be the proper difference to distinguish a spirit from a body.
5. This is only an arbitrary and feigned supposition, and cannot be
proved either by the testimony of any of the senses, by sound reason,
or innate notions; and what is or cannot be proved by some of
these (according to his own position) ought to be rejected. And
therefore as indiscerpibility is no proper difference of a spirit from
a body, no more is penetrability, which can no more be in a spiritual
substance, than either in discreet quantity one can be two, or
two one, or in continuate quantity one inch can be two, or two can
become one. D<sup>r</sup> <em>Glisson</em> from his much admired <em>Suarius</em> the great
Weaver of fruitless Cobwebs, hath devised another difference of
spirit from body which he thus layeth down, as we give it in this
English. “I assign (he saith) a twofold difference betwixt the substance
of matter and that of spirits. The first is taken from the
substantial (<i><span lang="co">à substantiali materiæ mole</span></i>) heap or weight of the
matter. For I (he saith) besides the actual and accidental extension,
do attribute to the matter this substantial heap or weight
which is denied to spirits. But the sign of this heap or weight is,
that if the matter in the same space be duplicated, triplicated, or
centuplicated, that it will be made more dense twofold, threefold,
or an hundred fold. And concludeth thus: I answer (he saith)
that matter and spirit in this do agree betwixt themselves, that
they both are finite, and from thence that they have this common,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>that neither of them can reduce themselves into a littleness that
is infinite, or into an infinite magnitude. Therefore the difference
betwixt them doth not consist in this; but in this, that a spirit whether
it be contracted or dilated, is not made more dense or rare; but
on the contrary, matter, whether it be contracted or expanded, is
made more dense, or more rare.” To which we return this responsion.
1. It is usual with men, when by their wills and fancies they would
maintain an opinion that is weak and groundless, finding they cannot
clearly perform it, to bring in some strange, obscure or equivocal
word, thereby to make a flourish, though they prove nothing: So here
this learned person to make a shew to prove the difference of spirit
doth assign <i><span lang="la">moles substantialis</span></i> as peculiar to body, but not to spirit;
but what is to be understood by <i><span lang="la">moles</span></i>, he might know his own
meaning, but I am sure there are few others that do or can understand
it, and therefore is but a devised subterfuge to stumble and blind mens
intellects, and not to prove the thing intended. 2. If by the word
<i><span lang="la">moles</span></i> he intend weight or gravity (and what else it can signifie is not
intelligible) then it will not be a difference betwixt body and spirit,
because gravity and levity are differences of bodies in respect of one
another, and therefore can be none as he assignes it. 3. To assert that
a spirit when contracted or dilated is not made more dense or more
rare, but that matter whether it be contracted or expanded, is
made more dense or more rare, is easily spoken, but not so easily
proved: and rude assertions without sound proof, are of no validity,
and may with as good reason be denied and rejected, as affirmed or
received. 4. We have no density in bodies but in respect of the paucity
and parvity of the pores, so that less of another body is contained
in them, and that is accounted rare that hath many or greater, and
so containeth more of another body in them, and are qualities or
modifications that only belong unto bodies, and not at all unto spirits,
and is but precariously taken up by the Doctor without any
proof or demonstration at all. 5. If spirits cannot expand themselves
into an infinite space, nor contract themselves into an infinite
littleness, then where are bounds and limits of this contraction and
expansion, or how is it proved that they can do either? seeing they
are properties and affections of bodies and matter, and never were
proved to be peculiar to spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Those that are much affected to and zealous for experimental
Philosophie, do often run into that extream, as utterly to condemn
and throw away all the ancient Scholastick Learning, as though
there were nothing in it of verity or worth: But this is too severe
and dissonant from truth, as might be made manifest in many of
their Maximes; but we shall only instance in one as pertinent to our
present purpose, which is this: <i><span lang="la">Imaginatio non transcendit Continuum</span></i>.
And this if we perpend it seriously, is a most certain and
transcendant truth; for when we come to cogitate and conceive of
a thing, we cannot apprehend it otherwise than as continuate
and corporeal; for what other notions soever we make of things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>they are but adventitious, arbitrary, and fictitious, for even <i><span lang="la">non entia
ad modum entium concipiuntur</span></i>. And therefore those that pretend
that Angels are meerly incorporeal, must needs err, and put
force upon their own faculties, which cannot conceive a thing that
is not continuate and corporeal: But if they will trust their own
Cogitations and faculties rightly disposed, and not vitiated, then
they must believe that Angels are Corporeal, and not meerly and
simply spirits, for absolutely nothing is so but God only.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. If the Angelical nature were simply and absolutely spiritual
and incorporeal, then they would be of the same essential Identity
with God, which is simply impossible. For the Angels were not
Created forth of any part of Gods Essence, for then he should be
divisible, which he is not, nor can be, his Essence being simplicity,
unity, and Identity it self, and therefore the Angels must of necessity
be of an essence of Alterity, and different from the essence of God.
Now God being a simple, pure, and absolute spirit in the Identity
of his essence, if the Angels were simply and absolutely spiritual
and incorporeal, then they must be of the same essence with him,
which is absurd and impossible; and therefore they have Alterity in
them, and so of necessity must be Corporeal, and not simply and
meerly spiritual. And that as much as we contend for here is granted
by D<sup>r</sup> <em>Moore</em> in these words: “For (he saith) I look upon Angels
to be as truly a compound Being consisting of soul and body,
as that of men and brutes.” Whereby he plainly asserteth their Composition,
and so their Alterity, and therefore that they must needs
have an <i><span lang="la">Internum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">externum</span></i>, as the learned and Christian Philosopher
D<sup>r</sup> <em>Fludd</em> doth affirm in these words: <i><span lang="la">Certum est igitur inesse
ipsis (scilicet Angelis) aliud, quod agit, aliud autem, quod
patitur; nec verò illud secundùm quod agunt, aliud quam actus
esse poterit, qui forma dicitur; neq; etiam illud secundum quod patiuntur,
est quicquam præter potentiam, hæc autem materia appellatur</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Therefore to conclude, these arguments do sufficiently and
evidently prove that Angels are either Corporeal, or have bodies
united unto them, which is all one to our purpose whether way
soever it be taken. To which only we shall add these authorities;
and first S. <em>Bernard</em> tells us thus much rendered into English. “Therefore
(he saith) as we render unto God alone true immortality,
so also incorporeity, because he alone doth so far transcend the
universal Corporeal nature of spirits, that he doth not stand need
of any body whatsoever, in any operation whatsoever, being
content with only a spiritual nodd (or motion) when he will, to
perform whatsoever he pleaseth. Therefore only that majesty of
his, is that, which neither for himself, nor for another, hath need
of the help of a Corporeal instrument, by which omnipotent
will he is immediately present at every work.” And that of <em>Damascen</em>
is full to the purpose, which is this: “That Angels <i><span lang="la">quantum
ad nos</span></i>, are said to be incorporeal and immaterial: but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>compared to God, are found to be Corporeal and material.” And
of this opinion besides were <em>Tertullian</em>, S. <em>Augustin</em>, <em>Nazianzen</em>,
<em>Beda</em>, and many others, as may be seen in the learned Writings of
<em>Zanchy</em> upon this subject: with whose words we shall shut up this
particular: <i><span lang="la">Certum enim est, ex iis quæ scripturæ tradunt de Angelis,
probabiliorem esse Patrum sententiam, quàm Scholasticorum:
utram tamen sequaris, non multum peccaveris, nec proptereà inter
Hæreticos haberi poteris</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>And on the otherside, if they be holden to be simply and absolutely
incorporeal, then these absurdities must of necessity follow.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. If Angels be simply incorporeal, then they can cause no Physical
or local motion at all, because nothing can be moved but by
contact, and that must either be by immediate or virtual contact,
for the Maxime is certain, <i><span lang="la">Quicquid agit, agit vel mediatione suppositi</span></i>,
as when ones hand doth immediately touch a thing and so
move it; <i><span lang="la">vel mediatione virtutis</span></i>, as when a man with a rod or a
line, doth draw a thing forth of the water, both of these do require
a Corporeal contact, that is, that the superficies of the body moving
or drawing, must either mediately or immediately touch the superficies
of the body to be moved or drawn. But that which is
absolutely incorporeal hath no superficies at all, and therefore can
make no contact either mediate or immediate; and therefore Angels
if simply incorporeal, can cause no Physical or local motion
at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Princip. Phil.</em> <em>Part.</em> 2. <em>p.</em> 40.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. If Angels be absolutely incorporeal, then they cannot be contained
or circumscribed in place, and consequently can perform no
operation in Physical things. To which if they answer with <em>Thomas
Aquinas</em>: <i><span lang="la">Quod circumscribi terminis localibus est proprium Corporum,
sed circumscribi terminis essentialibus, est commune cuilibet
Creaturæ, tam corporali, quam spirituali</span></i>; This aiery distinction
might have taken place, if <em>Aquinas</em> had shewed us what essential
terms and limitations are, but of this we have no proof at all, and
what was never proved may justly be denied. For what a definitive
place is, was never yet defined, neither can we possibly conceive
an Idea or notion of any such thing, but only as we may make a
<em>Chimæra</em> or figment of that which never was nor is. For though
we may apprehend that they are not circumscribed in place, as gross
bodies are, yet it is not to be doubted, but that they move from
place to place, and do so consist in some place, that they occupy a
certain space of place, and this is most certain, if we believe (as we
ought) those things which the Scriptures do declare concerning
the mission and motion of Angels. And therefore notwithstanding
this frivolous and feigned distinction, we may conclude with <em>Theodoret</em>,
<i><span lang="la">Angelorum naturam esse finitam, &#38; circumscriptam, eóq; opus
habere loco</span></i>. Neither doth that avail to solve the business, and make
this a good distinction, which is brought by D<sup>r</sup> <em>Moore</em>, to wit, that
there are two acceptions of place, the one being imaginary space,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the other that place is the concave superficies of one body immediately
environing another body, and that therefore there being these
two acceptions of place (he concludeth) that the distinction of
being there <em>Circumscriptive &#38; definitive</em>, is an allowable distinction.
But by the Doctors leave we must affirm, that what he saith is
not allowable, and that for these reasons. 1. Because imaginary
space hath no existence in nature, but only in the fancy of the Imaginant,
<i><span lang="la">&#38; entia rationalia, non sunt entia naturalia ex parte rerum
existentia.</span></i> 2. Because it is a certain truth which <em>Des Cartes</em>
hath taught us, to wit: That the names of place or space, do not
signifie any thing different from a body that is said to be in a place,
but only do design the magnitude, figure and site of it amongst
other bodies. And that this site may be determined, we ought to
have respect unto some other bodies, which we may consider as immoveable.
And as we respect divers bodies, we may say that the
same thing at the same time doth change place and not change
place. As when a Ship is carried in the Sea, he who sitteth in the
Ship doth alwayes remain in one place, if respect be had to the parts
of the Ship, betwixt which parts he keepeth the same site: And
the same person doth continually change place, if respect be had to
the shores, because he continually receedeth from some shores, and
cometh more near unto other. 3. Neither is this distinction good,
because as the same Author tells us: <i><span lang="la">Non etiam in re differunt spatium,
sive locus internus, substantia corporea in eo contenta, sed
tantum in modo, quo à nobis concipi soleat</span></i>. 4. D<sup>r</sup> <em>Moore</em> granteth
that spirits are substances and have extension, and we affirm
that nothing can be so but what is Corporeal, and consequently
must be in place circumscriptively, and therefore the fancy of a definitive
place, is meerly a fictitious foppery, without ground or
reason.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now let us examine the objections that are usually brought
against this opinion, the strongest of which is to this purpose; that
if Angels be Corporeal, then of necessity they must be mortal, alterable
and destructible; to which I answer. 1. Because no Creaturely
nature is or can be immortal, <i><span lang="la">per se &#38; ab intrinsecâ &#38; propriâ
naturâ</span></i>, for God only is so as saith the Text, <span lang="grc">ὁ μόνος ἔχων ἀθανασίαν</span>,
<em>Who only hath immortality</em>; Therefore the Angels whether
corporeal or incorporeal, are not immortal, neither by themselves
or their intrinsick nature, either (as the Schools speak) <i><span lang="co">à parte
ante, vel à parte post</span></i>, because God only is so, exclusively considered
in regard of any Creature, and so the objection is of no force. 2. The
Corporeity of Angels doth not at all hinder their immortality <i><span lang="co">à parte
post</span></i>, for as God is only immortal in respect of Essence, Eternity,
Infinity and Independency, so Angels nor any Creatures, are immortal
in that point or respect, but only in regard of their dependency
upon God, who by his conservative power doth keep them
by Christ, that for the time or duration to come, they shall not die,
perish, or be annihilated; and this he can and doth as well perform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>if they be corporeal as spiritual, even as he doth preserve and conserve
the bodies of the Saints in their Graves until the general Resurrection,
and in the World to come doth keep them in immortality;
though they be changed and made spiritual bodies, yet they remain
bodies still. For it is he <em>that sustaineth all things by the power of
his word</em>; And it is he <em>that doth vivifie or quicken all things:
and if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath, all flesh shall
perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust</em>. So that the objection
is of no validity, because no Creature is kept in perpetual
duration, <i><span lang="la">à parte post, ab intrinsecâ naturâ, sed ex causis conservantibus</span></i>,
which is the goodwill, benignity, and blessed influence
of <em>Jehovah</em>, and not from any internal creaturely power. 3. Every
spiritual and incorporeal substance that is created, is as annihilable
by the prime power that created it, as is a Corporeal created substance.
And on the contrary, a Corporeal or material substance is
no more capable of annihilation by any power or efficiency of second
Causes, than an incorporeal and spiritual substance is; and
therefore whether Angels be simply incorporeal, or that they be
Corporeal, it neither maketh for nor against their immortality,
which consists only in the benign emanation of the Divine conservative
power of the Almighty: And therefore doth profound
<em>Bradwardine</em> draw that invincible, and undeniable Corollary of verity,
<i><span lang="la">Quod necesse est Deum servare quamlibet Creaturam immediatiùs
quacunq; causa creata</span></i>. 4. Though the most of the bodies that
are known unto us be divisible, alterable and discerpible, or dissipable
in respect of our conceptions of them, yet actually we may
find many bodies in nature that are not, nor ever were dissipated
or dissevered <i><span lang="la">secundum totum</span></i>, though there may be alteration in
their superficial parts, as the Earth, the Sun, Moon, the rest of the
Planets, and those great and glorious bodies that we call Stars; so
that for the duration of bodies <i><span lang="co">à parte post</span></i> we can conclude little
of certainty. And as there are bodies that <i><span lang="la">secundum suum totum</span></i>,
are not severed or dissipated, so there are some bodies that though
they may suffer division and dissipation into smaller parts, yet do
those parts though most minute, suffer no real transmutation, but
remain of the same Homogeneous nature they were before, as is
most manifest in Silver dissolved in <i><span lang="la">Aqua fortis</span></i>, wherein though
it be so severed and dispersed, that it appear not at all unto the
eye, yet may it be from thence recovered and redintegrated into
its own nature as it was before. And also the Masters of the more
abstruse Philosophy affirm to us upon their own certain experience,
that though metallick <em>Mercury</em> may be divided into insensible and
invisible Atomes, yet still it retains the nature of metallic <em>Mercury</em>,
and that thus <em>Helmont</em> tells us: <i><span lang="la">Si non vidissem argentum vivum eludere
quamcunq; artificum operam, adeò, quod aut totum avolet adhuc
integrum, aut totum in igne permaneat, atq; utrolibet modo, servet
impermutabilem sui ac primitivam identitatem, identitatisq; homogeneitatem
anaticam: dicerem artem non esse veram, quæ vera est,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>sine mendacio, atq; longè verissima</span></i>. So also there are bodies which
although they suffer division and separation by some other bodies
dissevering of them, yet by motion of coition they soon close and
redintegrate themselves, having thereby suffered no detriment at
all, as is most apparent in the pure body of the Æther, the visible
species of things, the images in a Looking-glass and in shadows,
which are all bodies. So that seeing bodies, no more than Spirits
to be annihilable by second causes, and that there are some bodies
that are not dissipated <i><span lang="la">secundum totum</span></i>, and that there are others
that though they are separable into more minute particles, yet do
they remain in Analytical and Homogeneous Identity, and that
there are others that though they be actually for a small moment divided,
yet they do instantaneously coalesce, and by coition unite
themselves; yet we may therefore rationally conclude, that corporeity,
<i><span lang="la">quatenus</span></i> such, doth not at all take away immortality <i><span lang="co">à parte
post</span></i>, because bodies as well as spirits may be kept in immortality
by the conservative concourse of Divine Power, and so the objection
utterly falls to the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. There is only another argument that the persons of the other
opinion have urged, such as <em>Aquinas</em>, and the rest of the Scholastick
rabble, to wit, the Text in the Psalm, which is this: <em>Who maketh
his Angels spirits: his ministers a flaming fire</em>. From whence they
would positively conclude that they are spirits, and absolutely incorporeal;
but fail of their purpose for these clear reasons. 1. The
Text there cannot be rationally understood of their creation, or of
their creaturely nature, but of their offices and administrations, because
the word used there is not from <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>בָּרָא</span><a id='t211'></a> to create, or form forth
of nothing, but from <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>עָשָא</span> <i><span lang="la">fecit</span></i>, that is by ordering them in their
offices and ministrations. And again the word <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>רוּחַ</span> doth not alwaies
or of necessity signifie an incorporeal thing but that which is a body,
as the winds, and so doth <em>Luther</em> and diverse others render it,
and it is commonly attributed to beasts as well as Men, as in that of
<em>Solomon</em>, <em>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</em> Where the
word spirit, which is all one in the Hebrew, is attributed to beasts
as well as to men, but no man (I suppose) will believe that the spirit
of a beast is simply incorporeal, and therefore by the word spirit
in the Psalm cannot necessarily be understood a simple incorporeal
substance, and therefore the consequence is not necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews must needs be taken
for the best Expositor of these words of the Psalmist, who doth
quote them only for this purpose, to prove that Christ in dignity
and office is far above the Angels who are all ordered to serve and
obey him, and are by their offices all but ministring spirits, sent
forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of Salvation. By which
it is manifest that this place is to be understood of their ministration
and offices, and not of their nature or substances. 2. They can
no more be meerly and literally said to be spirits, understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>spirit to intend an absolute incorporeal substance, than his ministers
can be literally understood to be flaming fire, they must either be
both literally true, which is absolutely absurd, or else those words
must have a metaphorical interpretation, as they may and must
have, and there is no inconvenience in that exposition. For as the
winds, which is but a strong motion of the air, and the shining or
flaming fire, are two of the most quick, agile and operative agents
that are known unto us in nature, so the Angels and Christs Ministers
are strong, quick and most nimble and powerful in performing
their offices and administrations. Therefore we shall conclude
this as <em>Scheibler</em> doth from S. <em>Augustine</em>: <i><span lang="la">Nihil enim invisibile &#38;
incorporeum naturâ credendum est, præter solum Deum, qui ex eo incorporeus
&#38; invisibilis dicitur, quia infinitus, &#38; incircumscriptus
est, &#38; simplex, &#38; sibi omnibus modis sufficiens se ipso, &#38; per seipsum:
omnis verò rationalis creatura corporea est, Angeli &#38; omnes Virtutes
corporeæ sunt, licet non subsistunt in carne</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Judges 13. 20.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Dan. 3. 24, 25.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 24. 39.</div>

<p class='c008'>Now though we have sufficiently proved that they are corporeal,
that is, that they have bodies naturally united unto them, and so
have an <i><span lang="la">internum</span></i>, or moving power, and an <i><span lang="la">externum</span></i>, or a part
moved, that is, as Dr. <em>Moore</em> confesseth, a spiritual and incorporeal
part, and a corporeal part or vehicle, yet to assign what kind of
bodies they have, or what proper difference there is betwixt their
substance and other corporeal substances is no easie matter to determine.
Only we shall give two differences whereby they are distinguished
from other substances that are corporeal, and that as the
Scripture holdeth them forth unto us. 1. The first differential distinction
is, that their bodies do not suffer, or are altered or dissipated,
by the most strong, and operative sublunary agent that is known
unto us: Amongst which we have none of greater force and activity
than our culinary fire, yet it is manifest that that Element did
not work upon nor burn the Angel that appeared to <em>Manoah</em> and
his Wife, <em>who ascended in the flame of the altar</em>, and was not touched,
or altered at all, which plainly sheweth that his body was not
to be wrought upon by the fierce flame of sublunary fire, and he
is there called the Angel of <em>Jehovah</em>. This also is confirmed by
that which <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> saw, and confessed, that though <em>there
were three men only cast into the fiery furnace</em>, yet he saw a fourth
(which by all the learned is judged to be an Angel) <em>and they had
no hurt upon them</em>, that is, the fire did not work upon their bodies
to burn, alter, or consume them. So that in this the bodies
of Angels differ from the most of other bodies, because they do not
suffer by sublunary fire, the most violent agent that we know. And
this must needs rationally be taken to be proper unto Angels in regard
of their created natures, and not as superadded by a Divine
and Almighty Power, as in some other cases it may be granted.
2. A second difference is, that what bodies soever spirits or Angels
have, or appear in, they have not flesh and bones such as Christ
had in his true and numerical body in which he did appear after his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>resurrection, which was the same individual body which he had
before he was crucified. But though they have bodies, yet to feeling
and tangibility they have not flesh and bones as humane bodies
have, which have a renitency and resistibility to our touch, which
their bodies have not, being as it were ethereal, airy and shadowy;
and yielding and giving way to the touch, and though to be divided
and separated, yet, maybe, do as soon close by counition, and
so suffer nothing at all by that division.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Saints Everlast. rest</em>, <em>c.</em> 7. <em>part</em> 2. <em>p.</em> 255.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Sup. Cantic.</em> <em>p.</em> 504.</div>

<p class='c008'>Concerning the properties of their bodies it seems to have been
the opinion of <em>Tertullian</em> (as I find him quoted by Mr. <em>Baxter</em>)
that they had thin pure and aereal bodies which they could dilate
and expand, condense and contract at their pleasures, and so frame
them into diverse and sundry shapes; his words are these: <i><span lang="la">Dæmones
sua hæc corpora contrahunt, &#38; dilatant, ut volunt: sicut etiam
lumbrici, &#38; alia quædam insecta</span></i>. So we see that some worms and
insects will extend themselves into a vast length and smallness, that
they can pass through a very small hole, or passage, and again contract
themselves into a great bulk, drawing in the length, and increasing
the breadth and thickness, which though it still be the same
corporeal substance, and in general doth, in what figure soever it
be brought into, but retain the same dimensions in respect of place,
yet in regard of accidental shape or figure it may change the dimensions
in respect of one another, as one while to be more in longitude,
and less in breadth and depth, and sometimes more in breadth
and depth, and less in length. So may the bodies of Angels by
contraction and dilatation, sundry wayes alter their dimensions,
and consequently their shapes and figures, and all this according to
the motion and act of their own wills, so that still there must be limits
to these acts of distention and contraction, that they can do neither
in an infinite degree as either to become an insensible and indivisible
prick, nor to be infinitely expanded or dilated, and this opinion
hath sufficiency of rationality and intelligibility in it. Of this very
point S. <em>Bernard</em> speaketh thus modestly: <i><span lang="la">Videntur Patres de hujusmodi
diversa sensisse, nec mihi perspicuum est undè alterutrum
doceam: &#38; nescire me fateor</span></i>. And though we cannot punctually
enumerate, nor assign the certain properties of their bodies, yet we
may rationally conclude thus much. 1. That they being creatures
ordained for high and noble ends must needs have their bodies and
organs fitted and suitably proportioned to fulfil and accomplish
those ends, as doth most manifestly appear by the bodies and organs
of all other creatures, which are most wisely and fitly framed
by the Almighty, according to the several ends and uses they were
created and ordained for. 2. It is most probable that considering
there are creatures that as their wills are moved by their passions
and affections can alter the colours and figures of their own bodies,
as is manifest in worms, and in the colours of the Chameleon, as it
is asserted by the experience of the learned Physician <em>Dominicus
Panarolus</em>, so from the less to the more, that Angels have bodies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>far more excellency to perform their ministrations in, than those
gross and terrestrial bodies have that are here below. And it is no
small wonder to observe our ordinary <i><span lang="la">Gallus Turcicus vel Gallopavus</span></i>,
how quiet and demissly sometimes he goes, and then again upon
the suddain by some emotion of spirit, how will his train be
advanced and extended, his barbles swelled and puffed up, and
the appendicle that comes over the bill or <em>rostrum</em>, be extended
or contracted at the pleasure of the animal: And much
more to consider the quick and suddain change of the colours of
both those parts, as sometimes to a whitishness, or an ash-colour, sometimes
purple, sometimes blewish, and sometimes pure red, so quick
a motion that creature can give to the spirits and blood, that they
can so quickly alter and change, not only the colours, but also the
magnitude. And much more may we rationally believe that Angels
can alter and change the figure and colour of their bodies according
to the ministrations they are imployed about.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mark 12. 25.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 15. 44.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. The Scripture informeth us that in or at <em>the resurrection, the
bodies of men shall be as the Angels that are in heaven</em>, <i><span lang="la">sicut Angeli</span></i>:
Now this Analogy, comparison, or assimilation, would be altogether
false if Angels had no bodies at all, but were meerly incorporeal;
then it would follow, that the bodies after the resurrection
were made meer Spirits, and so ceased to be bodies, which is false
according to the doctrine of S. <em>Paul</em>, who sheweth us plainly that
after the resurrection they are changed in qualities into <span lang="grc">σώματα
πνευματικὰ</span> <em>spiritual bodies, for there is a natural Soul</em> or Animal
<em>body</em>, and so likewise, <em>there is a spiritual body</em>. From whence we
necessarily conclude that Angels have Bodies, and that they are pure
spiritual ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now we shall come to the other point intended in this Chapter,
that is to shew that the opinion of Angels assuming bodies of the
Elements here below, is a meer figment, as must of necessity follow
if this be a truth that we have proved, to wit, that they have bodies;
for then assuming of other bodies must needs be in vain and
to no purpose: but we shall also shew the weakness and folly of that
Tenent by these positive reasons following.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Those that maintain the assumption of bodies dare not affirm
that they are so invested with those bodies, as are humane souls
with their bodies: for then there must be vital union, which cannot
be but by Divine Ordination: But it doth not any where either
by Scripture, or sound rational consequence, appear that either
God appointed, or gave power to Angels to assume to themselves
bodies of what shape they pleased, or that he ordained a vital
union, betwixt the Angels and those bodies they are supposed
to assume either by Creation, or Generation, and therefore if they
did assume any such bodies it must but be as we put on and off our
Garments, or as Players put on and off their Perukes, Vizards and
Garments according to the several things or persons they intend to
represent and personate.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>2. But the great question will be, who are the Taylors that shape
and frame them these vestments? what! must it be themselves
that shape and figurate these bodies, as snails are supposed to
frame and make their shells and houses? Surely not, because if
they be simply incorporeal, then they can make no contact with
corporeal matter, and without a corporeal contact there can be no
alteration nor organization of matter, and consequently, they cannot
frame or shape themselves such vestments; neither can any other
actor or agent be assigned that can frame them, and therefore
the Tenent is a most ridiculous figment. And again if they
should have such solid bodies framed of the inferior Elements, as
the body of a Serpent, as the Witchmongers do suppose the Devil
assumed when he deceived <em>Evah</em>, and such bodies as Demons are
vainly supposed to assume to carry the heavy bodies of Men and
Women in the air, then those bodies must needs be of that solidity
and compactness that they cannot suddainly be wasted and dissipated,
and then doubtlesly we should find them sometimes, as we do
the sloughs, <i><span lang="la">Exuvias</span></i>, or skins of Snakes, for they could not be
consumed in a moment. And it were horrid to suppose that God
should instantaneously create them, and as suddainly dissipate and
waste them. So that in verity there is nothing of certitude, but it may
be looked at as a Chimera and a Poetical Fable.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. And if the Angels had not such bodily organs wherein they
could move, walk, speak, and perform other such actions withal,
before they assumed or crept into such vestments, their being inclosed
and invested with them and in them would no more fit and inable
them to walk or speak in them, than would an hollow Image
inable a lame Man to walk, or a dumb Man to speak that were inclosed
in them. Therefore (suppose) as the Witchmongers hold,
that the Devil should appear to a Witch in the assumed shape of a
Cat, Dog, Foal or such like, and walk and talk with him or her,
if before that assumption of such a shape, the Devil could not
walk and speak, the having crept into such a vestment would no
more inable him to speak, than a dead Cat in an empty hogshead,
or wind pent in an empty bladder.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><em>Of the Knowledge, and Power of faln Angels.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>These evil Angels of which we treat, did doubtless, before
they left their habitation and did not keep their first estate,
participate of the same knowledge and power, that those Angels
still retain that did not fall into that defection and rebellion; so
that our disquisition must be, what knowledge and power they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>have lost, and what they still do retain, and this we may consider
in these particulars. 1. That there are many things of which they
are totally ignorant and nescient. 2. The knowledge that they
have is dark and confused.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 2. 11.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Chron. 6. 30.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Jer. 17. 9, 10.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 41. 21, 22, 23.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 2. 13.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Concerning the first, this must of necessity be a certain rule that
what the holy and elect Angels do not know, the evil and faln Angels
must much more ignore, except the knowledge of evil and
guilt, from which the good Angels are free; and these may be reduced
to these few points. 1. We here may consider that the knowledge
of Angels, is to be restrained into these three ranks; first either
their innate and congenerate knowledge, or secondly their infused
or revealed knowledge by God in his Son Jesus Christ, or
thirdly their experimental knowledge that they gain by observation
and experience, and it is of the first only that we speak in this
Paragraph, and the rest we shall handle anon. 2. That our cogitations,
desires and affections are not known to the Angels, unless they
manifest themselves either by external signs, or effects, or be revealed
from God; And these ways they may be known, but not otherwise;
for it is manifest that Satan had darted it, or put it into the
mind of <em>Judas</em> to betray Christ, yet had he so cunningly carried
himself, that neither by any effect nor sign did the Disciples know
it until our Saviour did reveal it unto them. So that the Scriptures
do plainly inform us of the truth in this particular, as, <em>For what
man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in
him?</em> For this is only proper to God to search the heart, and to
understand the cogitations, as saith the Text: <em>For thou only knowest
the hearts of the children of men</em>, he only knoweth them, and
neither Angels nor men: and though the heart be deceitful and desperately
wicked, yet <em>God doth search the heart, and try the reins</em>.
So that if the good Angels do not know the cogitations, desires and
affections of Mens hearts, except God either reveal them unto them,
or they be made manifest by signs and effects, much less must
the bad Angels know or understand them. 3. Those things that
are meerly contingent, and those which depend upon free will, cannot
be known of the Angels, unless they be revealed by God, as
is manifest by the Text. <em>Produce your cause, saith the Lord, bring
forth your strong Idols, or Diviners, saith the King of Jacob. Let
them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them
shew the former things what they be, that we may consider them, and
know the later end of them, or declare us things for to come. Shew
the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are
Gods: yea, do good, or evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold
it together.</em> And as the good Angels know not contingent things,
or those that depend upon free will, much less do the faln Angels
understand them, as is manifest in these examples. The Angel that was
sent of God to warn <em>Joseph to take the child Jesus, and fly into Ægypt</em>,
did not of his own innate knowledge, either in it self, or in
its cause (as the Schoolmen speak) know that <em>Herod</em> would seek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the child to destroy him, because it was truly a contingent thing,
and did only depend upon the free act of <em>Herods</em> will, and therefore
by Divine Goodness and Providence it was revealed to the
Angel, thereby to preserve the life of the child, and to fulfil the
Scriptures. Neither do the faln Angels know future events that
are contingent, or depend upon the free will of men, as is manifest
in Satans tempting and afflicting of <em>Job</em>, which he intended to have
been his destruction, and therefore did falsly divine and foretel that
<em>Job would curse God to his face</em>, but the event was not according
to his lying conjecture, but to the manifestation of <em>Jobs</em> Faith
and Patience, and produced his glorious restoration. So the lying
spirit in the mouth of <em>Ahabs</em> Prophets, did not know that <em>Ahab</em>
would go up to <em>Ramoth Gilead</em>, or that he should be slain there,
but that God did reveal it unto him, and sent him forth with a powerful
commission to prevail. So that all the predictions and Divinations
of the Devil or his Angels are nothing but lying guesses and
uncertain conjectures; for what can be expected from him <em>who was a
liar from the beginning, and the father of lies</em>? Neither were his
Idol-priests, Wizzards, Diviners or Prophets any better but meer
conjecturers and lyars, as was most manifest in all those Oracles that
were amongst the Grecians, which uttered nothing but cheats, lies,
equivocations and ambiguous responsions. And those amongst the
Jews were no better, who took upon them to foretel and divine
for others, but could not or did not foresee their own destruction,
as is manifest in <em>Ahabs</em> Prophets slain by <em>Elijah</em>, and the Priests of
<em>Baal</em> slain by <em>Jehu</em>, and therefore must all those needs be deceived
that run to Divining Witches and Wizzards, of which sort
of couzeners we have too many.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Object.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>And if against this it be objected that the Devils did know and
confess that Jesus was the Son of God, and therefore if they could
tell this that was so great a mystery, much more easily may they
know other inferior things, and so may foretel future contingencies,
to which we give this responsion.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. We only affirm that Devils did not know Christ by their innate
or inbred knowledge, but they might know him by the revelation
of the Father, and by the things that were written of him
by the Prophets, and by the observation of those things that were
manifested at his birth, and shewed and done in his life time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 8. 29.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 8. 31.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. And it is manifest that God did not altogether intend to have
him hidden from the knowledge of Devils, because he ordered
that <em>the spirit should lead him into the wilderness, that he might
be tempted</em>, that his power and victory might be shown over the
Prince of darkness. And the end that the wisdom of God had in
this, was that the Devils to their greater terror and horror might
know their Conquerour, and by whose power they should be tormented
and thrown into the Abyss or bottomless pit, and this made
them cry out saying, <em>Art thou come to torment us before the time</em>,
and also <em>force us not into the Abyss or deep</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Luk. 2. 11.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Math. 3. 17.</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>3. The Devils might know this because the Angels had proclaimed
his birth to the Shepherds, and told them, that <em>unto them was
born that day, in the City of David, a Saviour which was Christ
the Lord</em>: And they might know it from the appearing of the Holy
Ghost in the form of a Dove, and resting upon him, and by the
voice which said from Heaven, <em>this is my beloved son, in whom I
am well pleased</em>. And they might know it by the conquest that
Christ had over the Devil, and by <em>their daily being cast out by the
power of his word</em>, and command, as by the finger of God.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 2. 11.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. The mysteries of Salvation cannot be known unto the good
Angels, but by Divine Revelation, much less unto the bad ones,
as witnesseth the Text: <em>For what man knoweth the things of a man,
save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God
knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.</em> The mysteries therefore
of Salvation, as they have been decreed by himself in his eternal
counsel, are not known unto the Angels, but by the revelation of
the spirit of God and the complement and fulfilling of his promises.
So concerning the restauration or precise day and hour of the coming
of Christ, do not the Angels in Heaven know, though their
knowledge be vast and great, and therefore much less those faln
and rebellious Angels that are <em>chained in everlasting darkness, untill
the judgment of the great day</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Math. 18. 10.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Revel. 12. 9.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Pet. 2. 4.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Heb. 1. 14.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Josh. 5. 13.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Acts 12. 7.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. And as that which is not understood of the blessed and elect
Angels must needs be unknown unto the faln Angels, so likewise
there are many things known to the good Angels, that are hidden
or but conjectured at by the bad ones, as may be manifest in these
instances. 1. The blessed Angels know and see the face of the Father
in beatifical vision, as saith the Text: <em>Take heed that ye offend
not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their
Angels do alwayes behold the face of my father, which is in heaven</em>.
Upon which <em>Beza</em> hath this note: <i><span lang="la">Loquitur more seculi hujus, ubi
consistere in conspectu regis faciemq; ejus perpetuò videre posse, signum
est domesticæ intimæq; familiaritatis</span></i>. But the faln Angels are totally
deprived of this blessed Vision, being cast forth of Heaven,
as saith the Text. <em>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent,
called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the world: he
was cast out into the earth, and his Angels were cast out with him.</em>
And S. <em>Peter</em> tells us, <em>that God spared not the Angels that sinned, but
cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness</em>.
2. And as they have lost the vision and fruition of the mercies
of God, so they have utterly lost the knowledge of his will,
concerning his Covenant of Grace and mercy to the elect, for they
are only ministring spirits sent forth to tempt to sin, to afflict and
punish, and have still enough for the advancing of the Kingdom of
darkness, but have no knowledge of saving grace nor the mysteries
of the Gospel, but are all enemies and adversaries to God and the
Kingdom of Christ, and <em>goeth about seeking</em> continually <em>whom he
may devour</em>. But it is the blessed elect Angels that are <em>ministring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>spirits, sent forth for to minister to them, who shall be heirs of Salvation</em>.
3. The good Angels have the blessed messages revealed
unto them for the assisting and delivering of the godly. So an Angel
did comfort <em>Joshua</em>, and another warned <em>Joseph</em> to take the child
<em>Jesus</em>, and to fly into <em>Ægypt</em>, thereby to preserve the childs life;
and an Angel delivered the Apostles forth of prison, and many such
happy errands are made manifest unto them, and they imployed about
them, of all which the faln Angels are utterly ignorant, and
they are concealed from them.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. There are some things that the evil Angels know of, which the
blessed ones have no sensibility of, that is the knowledge of their
own guilt, and the experimental sense of the loss of Gods Favour,
Love, Grace and Mercy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jude 6.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Civitat. Dei</span></i>, <em>l.</em> 9.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. The second thing that we proposed to handle, is, that the
knowledge that the faln Angels have is dark and confused, which
is plain because <em>they are reserved in chains under darkness, unto the
judgment of the great day</em>. Now those that are kept or reserved in
darkness, must of necessity have their knowledge dark, and consequently
confused; and he also that is the Prince of darkness, and
the Father and Author of the works of darkness, must needs like
his children have his understanding darkned also. And therefore
we will conclude this point with the opinion of S. <em>Augustine</em> who
speaking both of the Angels that stood, and those that fell, saith
thus: <i><span lang="la">Ante peccatum autem tam isti quam illi perfectè omnia intelligebant.
Accessit igitur istis propter peccatum aliquid tenebrarum.
Proindè etiam tenebræ appellantur, &#38; in tenebris esse dicuntur, cœlesti
illa luce destituti, &#38; in locum caliginosum præcipitati. Ut indè
intelligamus nonnihil tenebrarum naturali etiam illorum menti
accessisse, in pœnam admissi peccati in Deum, Deiq; filium.</span></i> But we
shall only here speak of their knowledge in reference to things acted
in this elementary and sublunary world, and that in these particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Though they retain the same faculty of understanding that they
had before their fall, of the generation, motion and mutation of natural
things here below, yet is it much darkned, and far inferior to the
knowledge of the good Angels in natural things, the one sort
living and abiding in light, and the other being shut up in darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. What knowledge soever they have by their natural faculties,
or that they may be supposed to gain by acquisition, is by them
gotten or learned for no other end, but for the hurt and destruction
of mankind, and not as the good Angels who make use
of theirs for the benefit of those that shall be heirs of Salvation.
For as a good Physician labours and studies to know the nature and
virtues of Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, and their parts and
products, for the good and benefit of mankind, but a Witch or
poysoner laboureth to know their virtues thereby to destroy and
kill; even so do the evil Angels, and not otherwise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>John 8.44.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Thes. 2. 9, 10, 11.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. The knowledge of Devils whether natural or acquisitive is
spurious, erroneous, fallacious, deceitful and delusive; both in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>respect of themselves and others, for as saith the Scripture: <em>He was
a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because
there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his
own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</em> Therefore saith learned
<em>Rollock</em> upon this very place: <i><span lang="la">Hoc est loqui ex ingenio suo, quod
naturale est sibi facere; suum enim &#38; quod ex sese deprompsit, non
autem quod aliundè accepit, profert</span></i>. For as all the endeavours of
the faln Angels tend to the seduction and delusion of others, so are
they, and were they the deceivers and deluders of themselves: For
it is most manifest that their minds are so obcæcated and covered
over with darkness, that although they be not altogether in general
destitute of the knowledge of that which is just and unjust,
good and evil, pious and impious, yet they do not acknowledge
their own sin, as they ought, for they are so pertinacious in their
sin and wickedness, that they do not attentively perpend and consider
their own evil, and therefore are not truely sensible, or do
understand that it is evil, and therefore are by the just judgment
of God so absolutely obcæcated that they cannot acknowledge their
own evil and sin. And as that knowledge they have is so darkned
that they have deluded and deceived themselves, so all their knowledge
in respect of others is erroneous, fallacious and lying, as the
Text witnesseth of Antichrist: <em>Even he whose coming is after the
working of Satan, with all power and signs, and lying wonders:
And with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness, in them that perish.
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they
should believe a lie.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>4. In regard of the words, intentions and actions of wicked Men
they both know and may foretel much, because they are the Authors
and devisers of those evils and wicked thoughts; as it was
the Devil that pushed on the Scribes and Pharisees to accuse and
put Christ to death, for it was <em>their hour and the power of darkness</em>,
and it was Satan that had darted it into the mind of <em>Judas
Iscariot</em> to betray his Master: And therefore the Devils might probably
(if not certainly) know that his death would be brought
to pass; so that they may easily foretel what themselves have projected
and prepared instruments to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. The acquired knowledge of the faln Angels must needs be
great in regard of their vast multitudes and their being dispersed in
this caliginous air or Atmosphere, for the Devil is called the Prince
of the air (if that be literally to be understood) and he compasseth
the earth and walketh to and fro in it, and <em>goeth about, seeking
whom he may devour</em>, and therefore by their agility of body and
celerity of motion may easily know what is done and spoken, and
may so very quickly convey it one to another, and so may most
readily communicate things that are acted or spoken at an incredible
distance one from another; but yet all this no further than Divine
Providence will permit and allow of.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De ver. influ. rer.</span></i> <em>l.</em> <em>p.</em> 425.</div>

<p class='c008'>6. The Witchmongers and others do attribute a kind of omnisciency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>to Devils in respect of their acquired knowledge, which we
by no means can allow them, and that for these reasons. 1. Though
it be granted that they do grow and increase in the knowlege of
sin, evil, and wickedness, therewith to hurt, devour and destroy,
or gain more skill and craft to lie, cheat, delude and deceive; yet
that they either gain or gather any knowlege that is good, or for
any good end, is absolutely false, for <em>they abode not in the truth</em>,
neither are they lovers of truth, but are utter Enemies to all good
knowledge and verity. 2. That they may be Masters of all the arts
or wayes of deceit, lying, cheating and delusion, is no way to be
denied; but that they should (as many suppose) by reason of their
longevity and duration, learn and be perfect in any or all of the good
Arts or Sciences, is to me utterly incredible, because they are the
Corruptors of all, but the perfectors of none, else should they be
the greatest Philosophers in the World, which is false. And therefore
most Christian and pious was that Sentence of that unjustly
censured Person <em>Paracelsus</em> in these words: <i><span lang="la">Et licèt Diabolus quidem
plurima machinetur: hoc tamen cum omnibus suis legionibus
præstare minimè potest, ut vel abjectam ollam frangat, nedum eandem
faciat: multò is minùs quenquam occidere, aut jugulare potest,
nisi id mandato, permissu jussuq; ac vi divina faciat</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other main point that we undertake to handle in this Chapter,
is, touching the power of the faln Angels, and that is to be considered
in these three particulars: 1. In general in respect of their
power, either in spiritual and moral things, or in things natural.
2. Or in respect of spiritual and moral things in particular. 3. Or
in respect of Physical and sublunary things.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. And for the first it must of necessity be granted, that their
power since their fall is much diminished, or at least restrained and
chained and fettered up. For they becoming Rebels against the Almighty,
and not keeping their first Estate, but having left their own
habitation, it was most agreeable to the wisdom and justice of God
to take away from them the greatest part of that power and authority
that he formerly had given them, and so to imprison and chain
them up, that they might never be able to attempt or perform the
like Rebellion again; otherwise the Almighty should not have
used that wisdom that is ordinary with earthly Princes, who haveing
overcome those that rebelled against them, do not only disarm
them, but also confine or imprison them. And to this very
thing do the Scriptures allude, when they say, that <em>they are delivered
into chains of darkness</em>, and that <em>they are reserved in everlasting
chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day</em>.
So that though the Devils still retain their cruel, wicked and devouring
will and mind; yet they are but like the Lyon within the
Bars of Iron, or <em>Bajazet</em> in the Cage of Iron led about by <em>Tamberlan</em>, and
so though they be never so cruelly bent to do mischief, yet they are
under the Chains and cooped up in the Grates of Darkness, and kept
in Everlasting Chains that they are never able to break or unloose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>And though he be called the God of this World and the Prince of it,
yet that is not to be understood, that he is the Prince and Ruler of the
Creatures of the World, or that he giveth riches, health, honour or
the like, for those are the gift of God only and not of the Devil;
but he is the God and Prince of the evil and wickedness that is in
the World, for in that, and by that, he reigneth and ruleth; and
to this purpose saith <em>Rollock</em>: <i><span lang="la">Damnatio est Satanæ, qui peccati
author est. Nam vita hujus mundi est secundum principem cui potestas
est aeris, &#38;c. Dicitur autem Princeps hujus mundi, quia per
peccatum, &#38; mortem regnat in mundo: ut enim teste Paulo, Regnum
Dei positum est in justitiâ, &#38; pace, &#38; gaudio per spiritum sanctum,
sic regnum Satanæ positum est in injustitia, &#38; morte. Vnde ipse propter
peccatum per quod regnat, dicitur rector tenebrarum. Propter
mortem per quam regnat, dicitur imperium mortis habere.</span></i> And upon
this place St. <em>Augustin</em> saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Nunc Princeps hujus mundi
ejicietur foras, absit ut Diabolum principem mundi ita dictum existimemus,
ut eum Cœli &#38; terræ dominari posse credamus: sed mundus
appellatur in malis hominibus, qui toto orbe terrarum diffusi
sunt. Sic ergò dictum est: Princeps hujus mundi, id est princeps malorum
hominum qui habitant in mundo. Appellatur etiam mundus
in bonis, qui similiter per totum orbem terrarum diffusi sunt: Ideò
dicit Apostolus, Deus erat in Christo mundum reconcilians sibi: Hi
sunt ex quorum cordibus principes mundi ejicientur foras.</span></i> And
whereas also Satan is called <em>the Prince of the power of the air, that
worketh in the Children of disobedience</em>, it is not literally so to be
understood, as though he had the natural power of ruling the air,
and causing of winds, hail, snow, frost, rain, thunder and lightning,
for these are all ordered according to the will of divine providence
and the causes that he hath established in the Elements: So <em>David</em>
speaking of the Heavens, the Earth, and the Elements, doth conclude
thus; <em>They continue this day according to thine ordinances,
for all thy servants</em>: And it is he that ordereth all these, as saith the
Text: <em>Who covereth the Heavens with Clouds, who prepareth rain
for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. He
giveth snow like wool, he scattereth the hoary frost like ashes. He
casteth forth his ice like morsels: Who can stand before his Cold?
He sendeth forth his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
to blow, and the waters flow.</em> And all these fulfil the will and
command of God, and not the will of the faln Angels; for the
Text saith: <em>Fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind fulfilling
his word</em>; so that if they have any thing to do in the sublunary
changes or motions of Meteors, it is but only as instrumental and
organical Causes, working meerly as they are ordered and acted by
the first cause that worketh all in all, as the Christian Philosopher
Doctor <em>Fludd</em> hath most learnedly proved in his Treatise of Cosmical
Meteors, which I seriously commend to those that desire full
satisfaction in this particular. But the Devil is chiefly called <em>the
Prince of the power of the air</em>, because he is the proud, high, airy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>spiritual Prince and Ruler of wickedness in high or super-cœlestial
places, by which proud, airy, and spiritual wickedness, <em>he worketh
in the Children of disobedience. For we wrestle not against flesh and
blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of
the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places</em>,
<span lang="grc">ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>. Upon which learned <em>Beza</em> saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Homines
quorum fragilis &#38; caduca est natura, cui opponuntur versutiæ
spirituales, infinitis partibus potentiores</span></i>. And again, <i><span lang="la">Ista nomina
tribuit Angelis malis, propter effectus, non quod eos suâ vi possint
præstare, sed quia illis Deus laxat habenas</span></i>. And therefore S. <em>Chrysostom</em>
upon this place saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Mundi verò dominos eos vocat,
non quod mundum gubernent, sed solet scriptura malos actus hunc
mundum vocare, ut quando Christus dicit, vos non estis ex hoc mundo
quemadmodum ego non sum ex mundo</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. To consider their power in spiritual and moral things particularly,
we shall find they have no power in some things, but by
their fall have utterly lost it, as is apparent in these few points.
1. They have lost that freedom of will that they had by Creation,
and were partakers of before they fell, and agreeable to this is the
<em>Thesis</em> of learned <em>Zanchy</em>, which is this: “That all Devils have so
far their wills made obstinate in sins, the hatred of God, Christ,
and of Mankind, that from this evil they cannot will to repent,
and thereby be saved;” and this he thus proveth. 1. Because in the
Scriptures they are called, <span lang="grc">πονυροὺς κατ’ ἐξοχὴν</span><a id='t223'></a>, for they are now become
such, that they cannot be changed from their malice and
wickedness; because it is become natural unto them. 2. From
whence it is manifest, that the whole time since their fall, never
yet any of them hath given any sign of resipiscence. 3. If they
could repent and believe in Christ, then for them and their sins
Christ also should have died; for he saith, <em>that he prayed for those
that were to believe in him</em>; but they neither believe in him, neither
did he die for them. 4. But the chief cause of their impenitency
is the just judgment of God, that hath given them up to
hardness of heart, because they sinned knowingly and wilfully
against the truth. And this point is sufficiently proved by <em>Thomas
Aquinas</em>, the rest of the Schoolmen and many others. 2. So that
as they have lost freedom of will, so they cannot at all will or act
to be saved, or to repent. 3. And as they cannot will or act to repent
or be saved, so the whole acts of their wills are evil, malicious
and wicked, <em>being liars and murtherers from the beginning</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The third is to consider their power in sublunary and elementary
things which is the most pertinent to our present purpose, it
being the thing that some have magnified even to a kind of omnipotency,
and therefore we must the more narrowly ventilate and examine
it, which we shall do in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. How great soever the power of the faln Angels may be supposed
to be, yet neither in knowlege can they be deemed to be omniscient,
or in power to be omnipotent, because they are created
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Beings, circumscribed, limited and finite, and consequently can
perform no act that necessarily must require an omnipotent power,
and so can neither create things <i><span lang="la">de novo</span></i>, annihilate or transubstantiate
any Creature or substance, or pervert or put forth of order,
the things that God by Creation, Decree and Providence hath
set into their certain orders of Generation, alteration and corruption.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ut supra.</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>2. How great soever their power may be supposed to be, yet rationally
it must be taken for a truth, that they have not the same
power that they had before their fall. For as <em>Zanchy</em> saith: <i><span lang="la">Certum
est enim in universum, &#38; in genere, hac etiam in parte illos punitos
fuisse, ut non possint quicquid poterant, cum boni essent, nec
etiam quicquid nunc velint</span></i>. Because the Holy Ghost beareth witness,
<em>that they are bound in Chains</em>, and that Satan begged leave
of God to invade <em>Job</em>, that they fought with the good Angels, but
were overcome, and that they may be so resisted of believing men
that they may be overthrown. <i><span lang="la">Ac væ nobis, nisi potentia Dæmonum
infirmata esset, &#38; à Domino comprimeretur, &#38; compesceretur.</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Zanch. de op. Dei ut supra.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. And what power soever be granted to the faln Angels, yet it
is by the opinion of all the learned, restrained only to these sublunary
and inferior bodies, and that they have neither power by Creation or
Ordination, to work upon, move, or alter things that are Angelical,
Celestial, Ethereal and Superior, but only are chained in this
Caliginous Atmosphere, and impure air. For it is manifest, that
superior bodies work upon those that are inferior, but not on the
contrary, neither have we any examples that can prove that they
do operate upon Celestial bodies, and so their power (how great
soever some may suppose it to be) is only restrained to these inferior
sublunary things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gen. 19. 24.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 37. 36.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. The operations and actions performed by the faln Angels, may
be considered, either in the simple respect of their natural and created
power, and this how great soever it was before their fall, is not
only lessened, but that which remains, is limited and restrained
with the Adamantine Chains of the decree of divine providence:
or in respect of what power they may have superadded by God,
when they are Commissionated and sent by God to effect some particular
actions, as for example, <em>Moses</em> and <em>Aaron</em> had but the ordinary
strength and power that was common to other men, before
they were sent upon the message to <em>Pharaoh</em>, and made Instruments
to deliver the Israelites, for then were they armed and indowed
with the power of working great and stupendious Miracles. So it
cannot rationally be imagined that the two Angels that were sent
as Instruments to destroy <em>Sodom</em> and <em>Gomorrha</em>, did or could of
their own proper, individual and created power, bring down Fire
and Brimstone from Heaven to burn those two Cities, but that it
was brought to pass by the Power of the Almighty, as granted and
given to them for that judgment only, and not by that ordinary
power that they could always exercise, for the Text saith:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span><em>Then the Lord rained upon Sodom, and upon Gomorrha brimstone
and fire from the Lord forth of heaven</em>. Neither can it rationally be
supposed that one Angel hath by his created power, that ability,
that <em>he can slay in one night an hundred fourscore, and five thousand</em>,
as it is written <em>the Angel did in the camp of the Assyrians</em>, but
that it was brought to pass by the power of Jehovah superadded
unto him, to work the great deliverance of <em>Hezekiah</em> and his people.
Upon which place the learned Expositor <em>John Calvin</em> saith
thus: <i><span lang="la">Solus quidem dominus satis per se potest, ac certè solus nos
servat: Angeli enim, manus quodammodo sunt ipsius: Unde etiam
Virtutes &#38; Potestates vocantur. Interim hæc vis soli Deo tribuenda,
cujus organa tantummodo sunt Angeli, ne in superstitionem incidamus.</span></i>
From whence we may note these two things. 1. That even
Devils are but the organs and instruments by which God accomplisheth
his will, and executeth his wrath and justice, and so are
but as tormenters and executioners to act no more than what they
are appointed and commanded to do. 2. We may observe that in
times past they had large Commissions given and great power superadded
to perform great wonders for the destruction of the wicked,
which was done for great and extraordinary ends, such as in
these days the Lord doth seldom or never use, and therefore there
can be no reason now shewed why Devils should have any extraordinary
power added unto them in working strange feats for
Witches and Sorcerers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 25. 41.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. It will much conduce to the clearing of this point of the power
of Devils to examine into what place they are faln, or since their rebellion
into what Prison they are shut, and this we shall give in the Thesis
of learned <em>Zanchy</em> who saith thus: “All the evil Angels were
thrust down from Heaven, into places that are below the Celestial
Orbs, to wit into this air, and below, as it were into a caliginous
Prison, where they are reserved unto the Universal Judgment
as bound with chains.” And this is plain from the words of
S. <em>Peter</em>, who saith: <em>For if God spared not the Angels that sinned, but
cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness
to be reserved unto judgment</em>. To which accordeth that of <em>Jude</em>:
<em>And the Angels that kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation,
he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto
the judgment of the great day</em>. For as learned <em>Musculus</em> tells us: <i><span lang="la">Decet
Christianum hominem ea modestia, &#38; cautio, ut nihil affirmet, nec
si quis alius affirmaverit, inconsideratè recipiat, quod non certo veritatis
testimonio è sacris literis desumpto, confirmari queat</span></i>. To this we
shall only add what the acute and learned Theologue <em>Amesius</em> notes
upon this place of <em>Peter</em>, which in English is this: “In general (he
saith) we are taught, that they did not keep their first estate, that
is, they did forsake righteousness and that station in which they
were placed of God, and afterwards they have exercised from the
beginning, envy, lies and murther against Men. Also (he saith) we
are taught, that they were a great number that were partakers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>this defection, and therefore the Apostle speaketh in the plural
number. 1. They are said to be thrust down <i><span lang="la">in Tartarum</span></i> into
Hell by reason of the commutation of estate and condition, because
that from a most high condition, which they received by creation,
they were cast down to an estate most low. 2. By reason of commutation
of place, because they were thrust down from a place
of beatitude, where they were conversant about the Throne of God
with the rest of the Angels, into an inferiour place subject to sin
and misery. But that this place is in the lowest parts of the earth,
as the Papists do hold, cannot be made forth from the Scriptures,
but rather the contrary, for they are said to be conversant, and
to rule in the air, and to walk to and fro in the earth seeking the
subversion of Men. This at the least is manifest from the Scriptures,
and ought to satisfie those that are not too curious.
1. That they suffer a great change of estate and condition. 2. That
they are excluded and shut out from their first habitation.
3. That they are in such a place where they suffer both the pain
of loss and of sense. They are said to be delivered over to darkness,
partly in respect of sin, and partly in respect of misery; for
darkness in Scripture doth denote both: and they are said to be
delivered in chains, by a metaphor taken from facinorous persons,
that are condemned and kept bound in prison with chains,
and the chains are these. 1. Obfirmation or obduration in sins.
2. An utter despair of any freedom or deliverance. 3. A terrible,
expectation of extream misery, and an horrid fear of being cast
into the abysse or deep. 4. The Providence of God which continually
watches over their custody, imprisonment, and punishment.
They are said to be reserved to damnation, because they
are so bound up in these evils and miseries, that they never can
escape; and yet these are but the beginnings only of their miseries,
for they are hereafter <em>to go into that everlasting fire, that is prepared
for the Devil, and his Angels</em>.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Job 1. 7.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Pet. 5. 8.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Kings 22. 22.</div>

<p class='c008'>6. Though the Devils be said to be reserved in everlasting chains
of darkness, yet are they said sometimes to be loosed, and <em>to go to
and fro in the earth</em>, and to walk up and down in it, and <em>that Satan
doth like a roaring lion walk about seeking whom he may devour</em>.
Which must be understood (as we have shewed before) that in respect
of his evil will, malice and envy, he seeketh and desireth the
overthrow of all mankind, but yet is so restrained that he doth but
act, what, where, when and so far only as God doth limit and order
him. For though it be usually said that God doth permit him,
yet it cannot be understood as a bare and nude permission, as though
God should suffer him to go so loose and at liberty, that he may
exert and exercise his power to the uttermost, for then all the godly
should be destroyed both in Souls and Bodies, and God should
only sit by as a bare spectator, not as an Orderer, Ruler and Governour,
even as though an hungry fierce Lion that had been chained
up in a grate, should be let loose to rage and run where he would,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and to kill and devour what he could, and thus the Witchmongers
do suppose of him, which is false and contrary to the testimony of
Gods word. But when the Almighty maketh use of Satan or his
Angels, they are only so let loose that he hath a hook in their Nostrils,
and their Necks in a chain, that they can act no more nor no
further than he ordereth, and gives them leave to accomplish, and
thus are they limited not only by his irresistible will and decree,
but they are also watched over and ruled by the good Angels that
are as it were their keepers and overseers. So when the Devil is
used as an instrument to afflict Holy <em>Job</em>, he is first let loose to afflict
him in his Children and Goods, but not to touch his Body; and
the second time he hath leave and power given him to lay his hand
upon <em>Jobs</em> Body, but not to take away his life: which do plainly
shew, that he is not only and barely suffered to do what he will, but
hath his limits set how far he shall act, and no farther. And when
God maketh use of him for the punishment of the wicked, he giveth
him power, and ordereth him how far to act or prevail. As in the
case of the lying spirit in the mouth of <em>Ahabs</em> Prophets, the evil
spirit is sent forth with this commission, <em>And God said thou shalt
perswade him and prevail also: go forth and do so</em>. By which it is
manifest that he prevaileth more by the virtue of Gods command
and commission, than by his own proper created power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Lambert. Dan. Isagog.</em> <em>c.</em> 24. <em>p.</em> 68.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 10. 13.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Exages. Aphor.</em> 14. <em>p.</em> 133.</div>

<p class='c008'>7. It is manifest that as the good Angels are the Ministers of God
for the Salvation of mankind, so the evil Angels are ministring spirits
only seeking the destruction and damnation of Men; and though
God doth use the Ministry of these that are evil and have an evil
will, yet he useth them well, and to good ends, that is, as the executioners
of his justice to chasten the godly, and to restrain, or
destroy the wicked. Therefore God and the Devil do not afflict,
tempt or do any other thing for the same ends; for God acteth to
prove, preserve, and stir up to goodness, but the Devil acteth to
bring into sin and evil, to destroy and to bring to despair, as is manifest
in the History of <em>Job</em>. And therefore here we may consider the
several ways wherein God useth the evil Angels as his instruments,
and that is in these particulars. 1. God useth him generally for
temptation both of the good and the bad; so he tempted <em>David</em>,
Christ and the Disciples, for Satan had <em>desired to sift them as wheat</em>,
and therefore he is called <span lang="grc">ὁ πειρόζων</span>, the tempter: and these temptations
are internal and spiritual, for <em>we fight not against flesh and
blood, but against spiritual wickedness in high places</em>. And in these
as far as concerneth the faithful, he acteth but only as God permitteth
or ordereth him, as is plain in the case of <em>David</em>, where one
Text saith, <em>Jehovah moved David to number the people</em>, and in
another place, <em>and Satan stood up, and moved David to number
the people</em>: where it is to be noted that God did it as the director
and orderer, and Satan performed it as his instrument and servant.
And the Apostle telleth us; <em>that God is faithful, and would not
suffer the believing Corinthians to be tempted above what they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>able, but would with the temptation also make a way to escape, that
they might be able to bear it</em>. 2. God maketh use of him for the
chastisement and affliction of the godly, as is most manifest in that
of <em>Job</em>; but this only so far as he is limited, ordered and commanded
from God and no further. 3. When Satan as a tormenting or punishing
instrument is used of God, he hath his commission given
him how far only he shall act and proceed, beyond which he cannot
go one hairs breadth, as is manifest in the case of <em>Ahab</em> and the
<em>Gadarens</em> Swine, so that we may conclude this with the learned
Aphorism of <i><span lang="la">Piscator</span></i> in these words: <i><span lang="la">Etsi autem Satan seu Diabolus
cum suis Angelis Deo et filiis Dei adversatur quantum in ipso
est, nimirùm voluntate et conatu: non tamen effectu; ita nimirum
ut vel fidelibus perniciem afferre, vel quicquam efficere possit
quod Deus nolit. Deus enim illum potentiæ suæ fræno vinctum constrictumq
tenet: ut ea modò exequatur quæ ei divinitùs mandata,
aut concessa fuerint.</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>8. Lastly, we shall now examine the particulars wherein learned
<em>Zanchy</em> doth acknowledge the faln Angels to have power over our
and other sublunary bodies, and they are principally these.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De oper. Dei.</span></i> <em>l.</em> 4. <em>c.</em> 10. <em>p.</em> 186.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Acts 8. 39, 40.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Upon the supposition granted that the faln Angels have permission,
he holdeth that by their own proper created natural power,
they can as they please move in place: as to lift a Body up from the
earth on high, and then to let it fall or throw it down to the earth;
that they can transfer or carry a body from one City to another in
a very short space of time: Lastly, that they can move and agitate
bodies with every kind of local motion that none can resist them.
And that therefore all those strange transportations of Witches in
the air into forraign and far distant places (he holdeth) need not
be thought strange or impossible, and that they may be done with
great celerity, and in a short time. And this he thinketh he proveth
by the example of <em>Philip, who when he had instructed the Eunuch
in the faith and baptized him, was caught away by the spirit
of the Lord, that the Eunuch saw him no more, and that he was
found at Azotus</em>. Upon which we must make these animadversions.
1. That upon the supposition or ground that faln Angels
are simply and meerly incorporeal, this must be false, for then they
cannot move in place, nor agitate any bodies, as we have sufficiently
proved before. 2. And though upon the supposition that
they are corporeal, they may move in place, and may move and
agitate other bodies, yet that must be understood in a proportionable
measure, according to their power and strength, and not in an
infinite, or indefinite respect; for though one Devil may be supposed
to move or lift up that which would load an Horse, yet it will
not follow that he can move or lift up as much as would load a Ship
of a thousand Tun; and though one Devil might remove a Millstone
by his own created power, yet it will not follow that he can
remove the greatest mountain that is to be found. 3. And whatsoever
motion Devils may have here in the air, or power to remove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>and agitate bodies, yet the least of these cannot be performed but
by licence and permission from God, which licence and permission
is always for ends agreeable to his Wisdom and Justice; but for
God to license or permit Devils to appear to Witches in the shape
of Cats, Dogs, Squirrels or the like, to the end to suck upon their
bodies or to have carnal copulation with them, or to transport
them in the air to places far distant, to dance, revel, feast and to do
homage to the Devil (as the Witchmongers alledge) is for so impure,
filthy, horrid and abominable ends, as can no way agree
with the Wisdom or Justice of the Almighty, and therefore
must needs be false and frivolous. 4. And that which the faln Angels
are in the Scriptures recorded to have performed, may be considered,
whether they accomplished those things by their own created
power, or by the power of God granted to them when they
are sent forth to perform such or such an act: For as it may not be
rationally granted that the two Angels that were instruments for the
destroying of <em>Sodom</em> and <em>Gomorrha</em> did bring down fire and brimstone
from Heaven by their own created power, nor that the destroying
Angel in <em>Egypt</em> did in one night kill all the first-born by
his own power, but by the power of the Almighty granted unto him
in that mission, so it is not rational to suppose, that although Satan
might by internal motions and spiritual temptations prevail with
the <em>Sabæans</em> and <em>Chaldæans</em> who were his Vassals, wherein he could
work what he would, to take away the Oxen, Asses and Camels
of <em>Job</em>, and to slay his Servants: though (I say) he might do this
by his created power; yet that he should bring fire from
Heaven to destroy the sheep, or that he by his created power could
raise such a wind, as could blow down the house in which the Sons
and Daughters of <em>Job</em> were, and slay them, is not probable, but that
it was performed by that assisting power that was granted him of
God, to effect that affliction upon <em>Job</em>, that God had determined
for the trial and manifestation of his Faith and Patience, which
cannot in any reason be said to be done by Devils in their transactions
with Witches, and therefore must needs be Fables and Chimeras.
5. And whereas he addeth that the Devils can perform
all kind of motions with natural bodies, and that none can resist
them, it is too large by far; for by that rule they might shake and remove
the earth, which they cannot do, for it abideth firm according
to Gods appointment in the creation: And it is absurd to think
that the superior and good Angels cannot resist them, who have
far greater force and might than the faln Angels have. 6. And
whereas he would prove the power of Devils by that of the spirit
of the Lord conveying of <em>Philip</em> from the Ethiopian Eunuch,
which supposing it to be a good Angel, it must likewise be granted
to be furnished from God to have that power to carry him away,
and doth not necessarily conclude that the Angel did it by its proper
created power: neither is the consequence good, to argue that
what a good Angel may do, that therefore a bad one may do the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>same or the like, for their powers and strength are not equal, the
one retaining what he had by creation, the other losing much by
reason of his rebellion and fall; as an outlawed person hath not in
a civil respect the same power that another person hath that is under
a legal capacity, and as a prisoner that is loaden with chains,
gives and fetters, can neither walk, leap, or run so fast, as he that
hath none, no more can the fettered Devils move with that agility
and celerity that the good Angels can do that have no fetters nor
chains at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Apoc. 7. 2.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Sam. 24. 16.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Acts 12. 23.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. A second kind of actions that he assigneth unto Devils is, that
they cannot only move bodies locally, but also can alter them diverse
and sundry ways, as to make hot things of cold, and so on
the contrary, white things of black, and black of white, and can
make of fair things deformed ones, and so on the contrary, and
can make sound bodies sick, and sick bodies sound, affecting them
with various qualities. But these particulars he leaves altogether
without proof, except one Text in these words: <em>And he cried
with a loud voice unto the four Angels to whom it was given to hurt
the earth and the seas</em>. From whence we shall observe these
things. 1. It is granted that God doth make use of evil Angels to
punish the wicked, and to chastise and afflict the godly, and in the
effecting of these things that they have a power given them to hurt
the earth and the Sea and things therein, as to bring tempests, thunder,
lightning, plague, dearth, drought and the like; but that in
the effecting these things, they have a dative power above what
they had in Creation, and that they are commissioned and sent
by God upon purpose to fulfil and effect these things, and so are
as the organs and instruments to perform the will of God in his justice,
and are always for such ends as tend to the Glory of the
Creator: But for Devils to be sent to play such ludicrous, filthy
and wicked tricks with Witches, as is commonly affirmed, suits not
at all with the Wisdom and Justice or Glory of God, neither have
we any such examples in holy Writ, no further, but that Devils
only are Gods Executioners or Hangmen. 2. It doth no where appear
that the Devils can alter, or change the shape or qualities of
things at his own will and pleasure, but the contrary is manifest in
the Priests of <em>Baal</em> in the time of <em>Elijah</em> upon the Mount <em>Carmel</em>,
where their Idols or Gods were to shew their power by firing the
Sacrifice, a thing which if Satan could have done for them with all
his power, it had been most advantagious for his Kingdom; but
it is evident that he neither did nor could procure as much fire as
would burn the Sacrifice, though earnestly called upon by his best
Servants the Idolatrous Priests. But thou wilt say, his power was
then restrained and withholden at that time from effecting any such
thing. Well, grant it were so, what was the end that God used that
restriction upon him at that time for? was it not because God would
not contribute to magnifie the Devils Kingdom? nor to suffer
him any longer to deceive his people? But to discover the weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>of his power, who is not able of his own created power, to
bring forth fire where there is none, not able to break a paper
window, unless he have leave and power given him from God.
And therefore much less can, for the magnifying of his own power,
and to dishonour the Creator, appear as a Cat, Dog, Squirrel or the
like to Witches, suck upon their bodies, have carnal copulation with
them, or transport them in the air, for this were to advance his
credit too much, and utterly derogatory to the Glory of God.
3. Concerning Satans being an instrument and means to bring and
cause diseases, it may be considered these two ways. 1. In an
ordinary way he seduceth and draweth men to gluttony and drunkenness,
by which way of ingurgitation and excess they draw and
contract to themselves diverse Diseases, as Coughs, Catarrhs, Dropsies,
Scorbutick Distempers and the like. Others he draweth to insatiable
lust and concupiscence, that thereby they fall into the <em>Lues
Venerea</em>, and the whole troop of those dire and horrid Symptomes
that accompany it, whereby Men and Women undergo great misery,
pains, sickness, and sometimes death. Sometimes he pusheth
Men on so far in malice, wrath, choler and passion, and many other
such like ways, that they wound, lame and sometimes kill one
another; and in this sense he may be said to cause diseases diverse
ways. 2. But there is another way more extraordinary wherein
as an instrument he may be said to cause diseases and sometimes
death, as in that case of <em>Davids</em> numbring of the people, where
there died of the Pestilence seventy thousand, and though this Pestilence
was sent by Jehovah, yet was a destroying Angel the instrument
and minister in the execution of it, for the Text saith: <em>And
when the Angel of the Lord stretched forth his hand upon Jerusalem
to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the Angel
that destroyed the people, It is enough: now stay thy hand</em>. And
<em>Herod</em> for assuming to himself that honour that was only proper to
God, <em>was immediately smitten by the Angel of the Lord, and was
eaten up of worms, and gave up the Ghost</em>. And the Psalmist saith:
<em>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation and
trouble by sending evil Angels among them</em>, the Hebrew giveth it,
the emission or sending out of evil Angels. From whence it is manifest
that evil Angels are the organs and instruments of Gods
wrath, and as Ministers cause Plague, Pestilence and other diseases.
3. Thirdly, there is another great question whether or not the Devil
by his vassals, to wit, Sorcerers and Witches doth not cause
diseases and death, as is believed by those vomiting up of strange
things exceeding the bigness of the Gullet to get either up or down,
of which we shall speak largely where we handle the opinion of <em>Van
Helmont</em> concerning the actions of Witches: Here only we shall say
thus much, that the Devil is author and causer of that hatred, malice,
revenge and envy, that is often abounding in those that are
accounted Witches, which desire of revenge doth stimulate them
to seek for all means by which they may accomplish their intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>wickedness, and so they learn all the wicked and secret wayes of hurting,
poysoning &#38; killing, but yet we affirm, that what evil soever they
perform, it is by causes and means that work naturally, and so the evil
is only in the use and application, and not in the efficients or means.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Cor. 12. 8, 9.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Psal. 107. 18, 20.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Isai. 54. 16.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De inject. material.</span></i> <em>p.</em> 598.</div>

<p class='c008'>And whereas he holdeth that Devils as they can cause Diseases,
so they can cure them and take them away, we must crave to be
excused if we cannot subscribe to his opinion, and that for these
reasons. 1. Because of their causing of Diseases we have sufficient
evidence in the Scriptures, but of their curing of any, we have not
any mention at all; and though some will think this but weak because
it is negative, yet it is not probable, but as it expresseth the
one fully, so it would have given some hint of the other, if there
had been any such matter. 2. But the Scriptures do inform us,
that the gift of healing or curing Diseases, is not in the power of
Devils by their Creation, much less since as a gift bestowed upon
them, but floweth solely from God by the Ministry of good Angels,
of whom <em>Raphael</em> (that is, the Medicine or health of God)
is the chief. And that it is reckoned amongst the gifts of the Holy
Ghost is most plain: <em>For to one is given by the spirit the word of
wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit. To another
faith by the same spirit: to another the gifts of healing by the same
spirit</em>; but these gifts of healing are not given to Devils, but to the
chosen ones of God. And the Psalmist where he is speaking how God
afflicted and brought low the people of <em>Israel</em> by reason of their sins,
saith: <em>Their soul abhorred all manner of meat, and they drew near
unto the gates of death, but he sent his word and healed them</em>. And
God declareth, that if his people <em>Israel</em> would keep his Statutes,
he would bring none of those Diseases upon them that he had
threatned, for (he saith) <em>I am the Lord that healeth thee</em>, and this
he doth by the ministry of good Angels, or by natural means, and
not by Devils. 3. That Devils are no causers or instruments in
curing Diseases is manifest, because that were to make him act contrary
to his original destination after his fall, wherein in his own
propriety, <em>he is a murderer from the beginning</em>, and that both of
souls and bodies, and never did, nor doth any good to mankind,
either spiritual or natural, either real or apparent; for that were
to act contrary to his will, nature and disposition, and contrary to
the Ordinance and appointment of God who hath Created the destroyer
to destroy. Therefore Satan after his fall was not ordained
of God to be an healer, preserver, or sanator of diseases, but to
be a destroyer, a wounder and murderer; for his nature is become
so wicked and malignant, that his whole endeavour is the
destruction of mankind, both in souls and bodies, and so no healer,
no not of the least infirmity. 4. But he is that grand Impostor,
that by lying, cheating and delusion, laboureth to make his Vassals
and others believe that he can cure and heal Diseases, when he
can do no such thing, and therefore hath and still doth amongst
the Pagans, by the wicked Priests his Slaves, make the people believe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>that if the sick persons be brought before their Idols, and
there worship and pray, that they shall be Cured, when there is
not any jot performed in the way of sanation, but what is by natural
means, fancy, and imagination, or what is pretended to be
done so, by cheating, counterfeiting and imposture. And the very
same thing is practised by the Papists unto this day, in the pretence
of their false and lying Miracles, fathered upon their Saints and
Images, which are nothing else but lying cheats and Impostures, as
we shall fully make manifest hereafter. 5. The Devil internally
deludeth the minds of men, in making them believe, that Pictures,
Charms, Amulets, and such other inefficacious and ridiculous means,
have power to Cure these and these Diseases, when indeed they
are meerly inoperative, and effect nothing at all; but yet the Witchmongers
will needs have them to be <i><span lang="it">media operativa</span></i>, when they
are utterly inefficacious, and are only means of seduction and delusion,
to alter, change, or fortifie the imagination, by which alone
the Cures (if any such be effected) are brought to pass, and not
by any power of the Devil at all; and he operateth nothing at all
in them, except a mental and internal delusion, in making the Witchmongers
and others believe, that those things are wrought by a Diabolical
Power, which are only performed by the force of imagination,
and a natural agency and virtue. 6. Again, where there are many
occult and wonderful effects wrought by natural causes and
agents, as by appensions of vegetables, animals, or their parts, and
minerals, by magnetism, as the Hoplochrism, Sympathetic Powder,
by Transplantation and many other very abstruse and secret wayes
and means, the Devil laboureth to take away the glory of these sanative
effects, both from God and his Instrument which is Nature,
and to have it ascribed unto himself; and in this the Witchmongers
do him no small service, in giving that power and honour unto the
most wicked and wretched of all Gods Creatures, that is only due
to the Creator, and to his instrument Nature. And to conclude this,
I cannot but repeat that excellent and Christian Sentence of <em>Helmont</em>:
<i><span lang="la">Pigritiæ saltem enim immensæ inventum fuit, omnia in Diabolum
retulisse quæ non capimus</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. A third kind of power that he ascribeth unto Devils, is their
changing and transmuting of bodies, which is either in regard of
substantial transformations, or of those that are but in the external
figure or shape, or in the qualities, accidents and adjuncts only. Of
real transubstantiations, after a long dispute, he granteth, that they
cannot be brought to pass but by a Divine and Omnipotent Power,
which we have sufficiently proved before, and therefore shall forbear
to say any further of it here. And for what other portents, prodigies,
or lying wonders he can perform, we shall here examine and
discuss them to the full in this order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deut. 13. 1, 2, 3, 5.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Deut. 18. 20, 21, 22.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. We shall pass by what may be thought of the strange feats the
Magicians of <em>Pharaoh</em>, or <em>Simon Magus</em> did perform, as fully examined
and concluded before, and shall give those Texts of Scripture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>that mention the signs and wonders that Antichrist and false prophets,
that are Satans Instruments, can or do work, and they are
these. <em>If there arise among you a Prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
and giveth thee a sign, or a wonder: And the sign or the wonder
come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other
gods (which thou hast not known) and let us serve them: Thou
shalt not hearken unto the words of that Prophet, or that dreamer of
dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you
love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
And that Prophet, or dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because
he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God.</em>—Another
place is this: <em>But the Prophet which shall presume to speak
a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or
that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that Prophet shall
die. And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
which the Lord hath not spoken? When a Prophet speaketh in the
name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is
the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken
it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.</em> From whence
we may take these Observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Jonah 3. 4.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Orig. Sacr.</em> <em>l.</em> 2. <em>c.</em> 6. <em>p.</em> 193.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. That we may know he is a false Prophet, that speaketh a
thing in the name of the Lord, if the thing do not come to pass:
But yet this must be understood with limitation, where God sendeth
a Message by a true Prophet, where the thing is spoken positively,
but the condition is concealed, and not expressed, as in the
Message of <em>Jonah</em> to <em>Nineveh</em>: <em>yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown</em>: which was intended if they repented not, but implicitely
was understood (as the event shewed) if they did repent, the
Lord would spare them: of which Learned D<sup>r</sup> <em>Stillingfleet</em> hath
this Proposition: “Comminations of judgments to come do not in
themselves speak the absolute futurity of the event, but do only
declare what the persons to whom they are made are to expect,
and what shall certainly come to pass, unless God by his mercy interpose
between the threatning and the event. So that Comminations
do speak only the <em>debitum pœnæ</em>, and the necessary obligation
to punishment; but therein God doth not bind up himself
as he doth in absolute promises; the reason is, because Comminations
confer no right to any, which absolute promises do, and
therefore God is not bound to necessary performance of what he
threatens.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. That there are those that do foretel, or shew signs and wonders,
that do come to pass, and yet those that foretel them are false
Prophets, because sometimes God sendeth false Prophets with
power to work signs and wonders, thereby to try his people, whether
or no they will cleave unto him with all their hearts and souls,
or turn to other strange gods, or Idols; and this is ordered by the
Providence of God for the trial of the faithful, as was in the Case
of <em>Job</em>. But though these may be great signs and wonders to amaze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and amuse men, and likewise come to pass, yet are they no true
miracles, but are distinguished in this, that true miracles are alwayes
for the establishing and confirmation of the true Doctrine and
Worship of Christ, but the other are lying wonders, wrought only
to try the godly, or for the deluding and punishing of those that
received not the knowledge of the truth. And though there are,
and may be signs and wonders that are wrought by Antichrist and
false Prophets, by and in the power of Satan, yet these are all ordered
by the Wisdom and Providence of the Almighty, and Satan
is no more but an organ and instrument in the performance of
them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 24. 24.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Thess. 2. 9, 10, 11, 12.</div>

<p class='c008'>There are two other remarkable places of Scripture concerning
the Devils power in working signs and wonders, the first of which
is this: <em>For there shall arise false Christs and false Prophets, and
shall shew great signs and wonders, insomuch that (if it were possible)
they shall deceive the very elect</em>. The other is this: <em>Even him
whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and
signs, and lying wonders: And with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness,
in them that perish; because they received not the love of
the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall
send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie. That they
all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure
in unrighteousness.</em> From whence we may take these remarkable
observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. Though there arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and even
the Antichrist himself, working after the power of Satan, with
signs and lying wonders; yet though Satan be the organ and instrument
in performing these lying wonders, God is the Author and efficient
cause that doth inflict them, because they are <em>mala pœnæ</em>, and come
not by a bare permissive power, but are inflicted by him as punishments
upon the wicked, even those that received not the love of the
truth, and therefore these lying wonders cannot possibly deceive the
elect, but prove all deceiveableness of unrighteousness in them that
perish; and the reason why they are thus punished with the deceits and
delusions of Satan, is because they received not the love of the truth,
and therefore God doth send such strong delusion, that they might
believe a lie, and this he doth rightly and justly, that as <em>Beza</em> notes,
<i><span lang="la">Ita tamen ut soli increduli sint illius fraude perituri</span></i>. Upon which
place learned <em>Rollock</em> tells us this: “We are (he saith) to observe
that Antichrist is nothing else, but Gods Executioner by whom
he punisheth those, by his just judgment, who have not received
the love of the truth, but have contemned the Gospel: which is
so far forth true, that if there had not been, and now were a contempt
of the truth, then altogether Antichrist had not been, that is,
the Executioner had not been, whom God sendeth to execute
his just judgment upon those that despise the truth of his Gospel.
So that it is manifest that God doth make a just, and good use of
the very malice, and lying nature of Devils, in punishing those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>that did not receive the love of the truth, but deceiving them by
strong delusions that they might believe a lie; and this he doth
as sent and commanded of God, and so cannot go one jot further
than his Commission, or as far as he is limited by God.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. We may observe that how great soever these signs and wonders
be, yet they are but lying ones, both in regard of the end
for which they are done, and in respect of their substance. And
therefore how great soever the signs and wonders be that evil Angels
do perform, yet they are totally different from true miracles,
those being alwayes wrought for the confirming of the true Doctrine
and Worship of God, but these have their end only to establish
false doctrine, lies and erroneous opinions, or Idolatrous Worships.
So they differ in their substance, for those miracles that
God sheweth for the confirmation of his truth, are alwayes true
and real, being against and above the whole power and course of
nature, but those wonders wrought by Satan are but delusions,
cheats, juglings and impostures, which though they may seem
strange to those that are ignorant of their causes, yet do but all arise
from natural causes, or from artificial cunning, confederacy and
the like. And therefore we may conclude that what miracles soever
are wrought by a Divine Power, tend to the overthrow of
Satans power in the world, but all false miracles are wrought to
uphold the power of Satans Kingdom in the world, and following
delusions, lies and false doctrines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 4. 17.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. Therefore what signs and wonders soever Satan doth work,
they are no real and true miracles, for as Dr. <em>Stillingfleet</em> saith:
“God alone can really alter the course of nature. I speak not (he
saith) of such things which are apt to raise admiration in us, because
of our unacquaintedness with the causes of them, or manner
of their production, which are thence called Wonders; much
less of meer juggles and impostures, whereby the eyes of Men are
deceived; but I speak of such things as are in themselves either
contrary to, or above the course of nature, <em>i. e.</em> that order which
is established in the universe.” And this cannot be altered by any
diabolical power, but only by that which is Divine and Omnipotent,
which never doth it but for considerable ends and important
causes, as may be manifest from these unshaken grounds. 1. That
Devils can work no true miracles is manifest from the definition of
a miracle which is this: <i><span lang="la">Verum miraculum est opus, quod fit præter,
et contra naturam et secundas causas, cujus nulla Physica ratio potest
reddi</span></i>. But Satan cannot alter or change the order and course
of nature. Therefore Satan cannot work or effect a true miracle.
The proposition may be illustrated by an induction made of many
great miracles, of which there is mention made in the Old and
New Testament, all which are of that sort, that are repugnant to
the order and course of nature, and of which no natural or physical
reason can be rendered and given. Such were the taking of
<em>Enoch</em> and <em>Elias</em> into Heaven, the conserving of <em>Noah</em> and his Family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>in the Ark, the confusion of tongues at the building of <em>Babel</em>,
the fecundity of <em>Sarah</em> being old and barren, the passage of the
children of <em>Israel</em> over the red Sea and over <em>Jordan</em>, the standing
still of the Sun in the battel of <em>Joshuah</em>, its going back in the dial
of <em>Ahaz</em>, its eclipse at our Saviours suffering, the preservation of <em>Daniel</em>
in the Den of the Lions, and of the three companions of <em>Daniel</em>
in the fiery furnace, the preserving <em>Jonas</em> in the belly of the
Whale, the raising up of the dead, and the curing of the Man born
blind, and all the rest of those most true and wonderful miracles
wrought by our blessed Saviour and his Apostles. 2. The assumption
of the Syllogism is thus proved. It is the part of the same
power to change the order of nature, and to create things that
were not existent, and so the mutation of the order of nature is a
certain kind of new creation. But Satan hath not power, by which
he can create things that as yet had no existence, as all persons of
reason must needs confess. From whence it must follow that Satan
hath not power to change the order of nature, and consequently
that he cannot work true and real miracles. 3. The working of
true miracles is only a proper attribute of God, and incommunicable
to any creaturely power, for the Text saith: <em>Blessed be the Lord
God, the God of Israel, who only doth wondrous things</em>. And again,
<em>thou art the God that dost wonders</em>. And these two things the changing
of the order of nature, and creation S. <em>Paul</em> attributeth to
God as only proper to him: <em>God who quickeneth the dead, and
calleth those things that be not, as though they were</em>. Upon which
<em>Beza</em> gives this note:  <i><span lang="la">Eo qui vitæ restituit. Apud quem jam sint
quæ alioqui reipsa non sunt, ut qui vel uno verbo quidvis possit ex
nihilo efficere.</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Rolloc. in Thess.</em> 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>But if it be objected that though Satan and his Angels of themselves,
and by their own proper power, do not work true miracles,
yet may not God work real miracles by them, as he did by the
Prophets, Apostles and his Ministers? It is answered: That the
wonders which are wrought by Satan, do tend to that end, that
they might confirm lies against God and his glory. But God doth
not accommodate his power, to confirm lies, contrary to his glory,
and against himself. Therefore Satan by the power of God, as
his Minister, doth not work true miracles, for God doth use the
faln Angels as executioners of his wrath and judgments, for the
afflicting and punishing of men, but when God worketh any thing
for the good of mankind, either in Soul or Body, he doth not use
Devils as his Ministers, but the good and blessed Angels, who are
ministring spirits sent forth for the good of those that shall be heirs
of Salvation.</p>

<p class='c008'>And if it be queried, what things and of what sort and kind, are
those wonders that are wrought by Satan and Antichrist? I answer,
that either they are indeed nothing but prestigious juglings and illusions:
or if they be any thing, they are not brought to pass contrary
to the order of nature and second causes, although they may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>seem so to us, who do not know the causes that are in nature, so well
as that old serpent: neither do we apprehend the manner by which
he worketh and acteth his tricks. From which ignorance it proceedeth,
that those wonders, that in themselves are no true miracles,
nor done contrary to the order of nature, are by us taken to be true
miracles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Oper. Dei</span></i>, <em>l.</em> 4 <em>c.</em> 12. <em>p.</em> 191.</div>

<p class='c008'>But we will draw towards a conclusion of this point, with that
definition and corollaries that learned <em>Zanchy</em> gives us in these particulars.
<i><span lang="la">Miraculum (ait) igitur est externum &#38; visibile, verum &#38;
simpliciter mirabile factum, ad optimos fines atq; imprimis ad salutem
hominum, &#38; ad Dei gloriam promovendam editum.</span></i> From whence
these points are to be observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. That a Miracle is external and made visible. For so (he
saith) are all those things that we read of in Scripture that are taken
to be true miracles: And therefore that the pretended invisible
miracle of Transubstantiation (as they call it) in the ordinance
of the Lords Supper, is a meer figment, because no such thing was
ever made visible, or truely witnessed. But let us press this his argument
a little further. If it be (as indeed it must be) a certain
property of a true miracle that it be external and visible, that there
may be witnesses of it, otherwise that which none ever saw or
knew may be the property of a miracle: Then those great wonders
that Witchmongers do affirm that the Devil worketh with and for
Witches, as having carnal copulation with them, sucking upon their
bodies, making a corporeal and oral league with them, carrying them
in the air, changing them into Cats or Dogs, must of necessity be a
meer figment and an impossibility: Because never yet seen, witnessed,
or proved by any that were of sound judgment, right understanding
or of clear reason, but are meerly the works of darkness,
having existence no where, but in the minds and brains of the Witchmongers,
who are ruled by the Prince of darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. A miracle ought to be really and truly done, that is, that indeed
it be such a thing as it appeareth, as the water that Christ
changed into Wine, was really such, that is, it was truely Wine to
the sight and taste of all those that drank of it. Therefore those
things that are brought to pass by the prestigious juglings of Devils
and Magicians, are indeed no true miracles. And to apply
this to our present purpose, it is manifest that those things that
Witchmongers do believe that the Witches do or suffer, as to fly
in the air, to be present at dancings and banqueting, and yet to remain
empty and hungry, and the like, are but meer delusory dreams
and cheating fancies in their brains, and if any thing be done <em>ad
extra</em>, it is but meerly as Juglers do by drawing the eyes from observing
the manner of their conveyances, by substituting one thing
in the stead of another, and the like. So that at the best Satan in
respect of what he performeth in these aforesaid actions, is but as
a chief <em>Hocus Pocus</em> fellow, or Jugler, and one that acteth
to a worse end, than our common Juglers do, who act but to move
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>sport and delight, and thereby to get something to be a livelihood,
but Satan works his tricks to blind and delude the Soul, and to lead
it to error and destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. A true miracle ought to be simply miraculous and wonderful,
that is with and unto all. And such are those miracles, whose
causes are hid from all, and therefore are those things that are done
contrary to the order of nature, by the only virtue and power of
the Almighty God. Therefore those things that are done by natural
causes, though occult to many, as are oftentimes done by
Devils, are no true miracles. From whence therefore we may conclude,
that whatsoever is performed in Physical actions, by natural
causes, (and it is the general Tenent of all, that Devils in these cases
can work nothing but by natural causes,) are no miracles, and that
as they are agents, are not evil, but only become so in the use and
application.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Every true miracle is wrought above all for most good ends,
and especially for the Salvation of Men, and the true Glory of God.
By this particular therefore all those signs and wonders that are
wrought by Devils, are excluded from the name of true miracles,
because they are all wrought for evil ends, and contrary to the
Glory of God, and for the deceiving and perdition of Men. And
therefore all prodigies wrought by Devils, are called lies.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The fourth and last particular that he setteth down, that the
Devils have power in, and operate here below, is, that they can insinuate
themselves into and penetrate our bodies, and so move
Men diverse ways, driving them into the solitary places and Monuments,
and by throwing them into the fire or water, by strange
tearing and tormenting of them, and by many other ways, of which
we shall only note these few things.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It is manifest that in the times of our Saviours being here upon
earth, and his Disciples, that there were many Demoniacks or
Men possessed with Devils, or Men that were devillished, or over
whom the Devil exercised an effective and ruling power, and the
reason was plain and manifest, for our blessed Saviour being to
establish the Doctrine of the Gospel, by great and true miracles, it
was necessary that there might be fitting subjects for the effecting
of such stupendious miracles in and by, and therefore the Father in
his providence had prepared and provided Lunaticks, Demoniacks,
those that were born blind, and other strange Diseases that
the power of Christ and his Apostles might be manifest in their
miraculous cures. But whether or no that Devils have at all times
the same power over mens bodies is much to be doubted, there being
not the same causes or ends for permitting the same now that
was at that season, as we perhaps shall shew hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The manner of the Devils possessing of the minds and bodies
of Men, he laboureth to prove, to be essential and personal, and
not virtual and effective, which he thinketh he sufficiently proveth
by the words <em>to enter</em>, and <em>to dwell</em>, of which we shall only say
this.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>1. That upon the supposition that Devils are corporeal and have
thin, pure and etherial bodies, it may be granted that they may really
and substantially enter into bodies, for he saith: <i><span lang="la">Dæmones autem
habent corpora aerea, et aere etiam subtiliora et tenuiora. Deindè,
ut Tertullianus ait, Dæmones sua hæc corpora contrahunt, et
dilatant, ut volunt, sicut etiam lumbrici, et alia quædam insecta.
Ita difficile illis non est penetrare in nostra corpora.</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Dialog. disc. of Spir. and Devils</em>, <em>Dialog.</em> 2. <em>p.</em> 34. <em>&#38;c.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. But secondly, there is none of those places that he citeth,
nor any other that signifieth a local, or personal possession, or any
such local inherency in the bodies of Men, but only a spiritual rule,
<em>he</em> (that is Satan) <em>worketh in the children of disobedience</em>, or an
effective dominion over them, by which he doth actually afflict,
vex and torment Men sundry and diverse ways. Neither is the
word <em>Dæmonizomenos</em> translated or understood by learned Men
of an essential, or personal possession of Devils to be inherently in
men, but only of an effective dominion in afflicting and tormenting of
them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ephes. 3. 17.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>John 13. 2. 27.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Acts 5. 3.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Luke 8. 33.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Mark 5. 13.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Matth. 8. 32.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. And this is most manifest, that as the Text saith, <em>that Christ
may dwell in your hearts by Faith</em>, where it were absurd to understand
by Christs dwelling in the hearts of the faithful, a personal,
essential or substantial dwelling, but only an effective one,
because he worketh effectually in them by his spirit: Even so were
it absurd to take the other places of entring into, and dwelling
there, in so gross, and literal a sense, as personally to inhabite, but
only effective by his power and dominion. For though the Text
saith; that <em>after the sop, Satan entred into Judas</em>, yet in the same
Chapter the Evangelist expoundeth what manner of entrance it
was; not a personal one, but an effective one by putting, or darting
it, <span lang="grc">βεβληκότος</span>, into <em>Judas</em> heart to betray his Master. And whereas
it is said that Satan had filled the heart of <em>Ananias</em> to lie to the
Holy Ghost, no man can rationally understand it of a personal and
essential repletion, but only of an effective one, having by his
power seduced the heart of <em>Ananias</em>, and filled it with deceit by
his effectual operation, and not otherwise. And whereas it is said
by S. <em>Luke</em> and S. <em>Mark</em>, of the legion of Devils that our Saviour
did cast out, that they entred into the swine, <span lang="grc">εἰ σῆλθεν εὶς τοὺς χοίθους</span>
S. <em>Matthew</em> makes it clear, saying, <em>they went into the herd of
swine</em>, <span lang="grc">εὶς τιὼ ἀγέλιω τῶν χοίρων</span>, <i><span lang="la">in gregem</span></i>, or as <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> renders it
<i><span lang="la">ad gregem porcorum</span></i>, by which it is manifest that they did go amongst,
or into the herd of Swine, and put them into such a fright
or fury, by an effective power working upon them, that they ran
down a steep place into the Sea, and perished in the waters; but
not that they did personally and essentially enter into the bodies
of the Swine, for that were absurd and needless, for the Swineherd
can with his Horn and Whip drive them without creeping
into their bellies, and much more might the Devils drive them into
the Sea (according to the Proverb, They must needs run whom the
Devil drives) without a personal and local being in their bellies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>as though a Piper cannot effectively play several tunes upon his
Pipes, except he creep into them.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>If the Devil, or Witches have power to perform strange
things, whether they do not bring them to pass by meer natural
means, or otherwise. And of</em> Helmonts <em>opinion concerning
the effects caused by Devils or Witches</em>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>Having handled the knowledge and power of the faln Angels
as far forth as there is any thing manifested in the Scriptures,
or that may be deducted from thence by sound reason, and finding
their knowledge and power to be much less in these inferior bodies
and elements than is commonly supposed; we are now to proceed
to examine what they do simply of their own power, and
what they perform by natural means. And first it cannot be denyed
but that they can of themselves dart in evil thoughts, suggestions
and temptations into the minds of Men immediately of their
own power, as also to allure Men to sin by the irritation of external
objects presented to the senses, as also by means of the phantasie,
and especially by the melancholy humour which is <i><span lang="la">Balneum Diaboli</span></i>.
But secondly the great question is, what they work in elemental
and corporeal things, and whether it be not only by natural
means, as the applying of fit actives to agreeable passives, whereby
the acts ascribed unto them are performed, or not? Which we affirm
from these grounds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Gutter. de Fascino dub.</em> 5. <em>p.</em> 125.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. Because it is the common and unanimous opinion of Philosophers,
Theologues and Physicians, that what the Devils operate
in sublunary bodies, or in causing diseases in humane bodies,
is by the applying fit actives to convenient passives, by which
the effects are brought to pass. And this is an argument sufficiently
pressive, and convincing, if there be any force in arguments
brought from humane authority, especially considering that no other
causes besides what are natural, could ever yet be assigned,
much less proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De inject. material.</span></i> <em>p.</em> 597.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. And this is more plain if we consider what the Author quoted
last in the Margent saith to the same purpose, <i><span lang="la">Dæmon propria
virtute nequit transmutare materiam corpoream, nisi adhibeat illi
activa proportionata effectibus quos intendit</span></i>. As for example, the
Devil may cause burning, by reason that there is a combustible
subject, as also a fiery and burning agent in nature, and this agent
being fire, being applyed to combustible matter would produce
that effect which we call cremation, or burning: But if there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>no combustible matter in nature, or that there were no igneous agent,
then it is plain, the Devils could produce no burning at all;
and so where there is no agent and patient in nature, to produce
the effect intended, (as in pretended fascination there is neither)
there such an effect could not possibly be produced: so that from
hence it must necessarily follow, that Devils can operate nothing in
corporeal matter, but by applying fit agents to convenient patients,
and therefore <em>Helmont</em> said well: <i><span lang="la">Quasi Satanas supra naturam
esset, operareturq; naturæ impossibilia. Dono quidem, modum operando
exoticum: at sane ad intra naturam coerceri oportet.</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>3. And that many strange things that are vomited up by such as
are supposed to be bewitched do proceed from natural causes, and
that the Devil worketh no more in them but by instigation, to
move wicked persons (such as are commonly those that are accounted
Witches) to give and administer strange things, Philters, or
secret poisons, to such as they would kill, torment, make mad, or
draw to unlawful love, or rather lust, as may be made manifest
from the testimonies of persons of unquestionable veracity and
judgment, some few of which we shall here relate. <em>Philip Salmuth</em>
chief Physician to the Prince of <em>Anhalt</em> recordeth this which we
shall give in English: “The Daughter of a certain Inkeeper was
desperately in love with a principal Nobleman. To whom going
away she offers a most beautiful apple. This he suspecteth
and throweth into a Basket. After three days he remembers it,
and looks at it; and then it altogether appeared blackned. He
expecteth for the space of other three days, and then findeth abundance
of little Frogs there. Therefore he returneth into that Inn,
where the Maid lived, and doth counterfeit sickness and huge torments.
The Maid willeth him to use warm milk. That he poureth
upon the Frogs, who take it greedily, and by little and little
do increase. But he every day feigneth greater pains, whereupon
the Maid pitying him doth will him to take the urine of
a Mare newly made and warm. This he also poureth upon the
Frogs, whereupon they die. After some time the servant of another
Nobleman is afflicted with miserable torments, and there
is suspicion of a Philter given by a person of quality. They exhibite
Mares urine, and she vomiteth up two Lizards, and two
Frogs.” By which it is manifest that such strange vomitings up of
Frogs, Lizards, Askers and the like, though attributed to Witchcraft,
and the operation of Satan, do but proceed from natural
causes. And doubtless the sperme, or <i><span lang="la">ova ranarum</span></i>, were but conveyed
into the Apple, that so by the heat of the Stomach, and
the Chylus, (that is like warm milk) they might grow and increase.
And this kind of witching, or secret poysoning, we grant to be too
frequent and common, because those persons commonly accounted
Witches are extreamly malicious and envious, and do secretly and
by tradition learn strange poysons, philters and receipts whereby
they do much hurt and mischief. Which most strange wayes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>poysoning, tormenting, and breeding of unwonted things in the
stomach and bellies of people, have not been unknown unto many
learned men and Philosophers, but they respecting the good of
mankind, and the multitude of evil minded persons, have altogether
forborn openly to mention such dangerous receipts in their
writings, or at the best so to publish them, that not one of a thousand
could understand what they intended, and so these secrets of
mischief are for the most part kept in obscurity, amongst old women,
superstitious, ignorant, and melancholy persons, and by them
delivered over from hand to hand, and commonly one learns it of
another according to the Proverb, Popery and Witchcraft go by
Tradition. And to this very purpose I cannot but insert that remarkable
passage of <em>Paracelsus</em> in these words. <i><span lang="la">Possem equidem (ait)
peculiarem de ipsis tractatum edere, ut artes ac machinæ illarum
manifestarentur. Sed propter malitiosos ista talia pennâ seu calamo
minimè evulganda sunt, multa enim flagitiosa simul induci possent:
quæ satius est reticeri.</span></i> And that strange productions may be brought
to pass, and stupendious effects brought into action, from secret and
hidden natural causes, that are better known to those malicious
persons that are accounted Witches, than others, may be made manifest
by another observation set down by the forementioned <em>Salmuth</em>,
and is this: “<em>Galen</em> and others have recorded, that the <em>saliva</em>,
or spittle of a mad dog, if it touch an human body, and be
not forthwith washed off, may cause madness. But in the <em>Hydrophobia</em>,
there is so great force of the poyson, that the persons that
are bitten do also piss or void by urine, little whelps, or pieces
of flesh like them, as <em>Avicenna</em> <em>lib.</em> 3. <em>Fen.</em> 6. <em>tr.</em> 4. <em>c.</em> 7. hath delivered,
though doubted of by others. But (he saith) I certainly
know notwithstanding that of such <em>saliva</em> or spittle only
left in the Garment, after biting, have Worms been breed, plainly
resembling little Whelps with their heads. For a mad Dog did
meet a Servant Maid of an honest Matrons going to the Market,
and flies furiously and violently at her feet. She that she might
avoid the danger, inclineth her self, and a little bendeth her knees,
whereupon the Dog doth with his teeth catch hold of her Garment,
and especially the seam or low selvidge, and did bark a little
while, and forthwith ran away. Which being done the Maid
remained terrified, and at the first doubted whether the Dog was
mad or not, but having recollected her self, she suspecteth his rabiousness,
because he had been very familiar, even almost domestick
with her. Therefore she returneth home, and hangeth the
torn Garment upon a piece of wood in the House. But afterwards
upon the fourth day she goeth to it, with an intent to mend it.
But oh a wonderful thing, she findeth Worms altogether like little
Whelps in the head, to be bred in those places of the hem
in which the Dog had fastned his teeth, and those as a new Miracle
(as they did call it) were shewed unto certain of the Neighbours
being called together.”</p>

by natural Causes, and yet are so occult, stupendious, and
unusual, that they are commonly fathered upon Devils, when they
have no more at all to do in or about them, but only the mental
perswading of the persons to use them to wicked and destructive
ends, as those wonderful compositions that produce the Plague
and such like grievous Diseases and Symptoms; For this kind of <i><span lang="la">veneficium</span></i>
(call it Witchcraft if you please) is and hath been often
practised by most horrible, malevolent, and wicked persons, who
by an art more than Diabolical (especially in respect of the end
and use) have so framed, and prepared, and commixed things naturally,
that in the form of unguents have produced the Plague and
divers other most pernicious and venefical Diseases, which may be
confirmed by undeniable examples, of which we shall give some
few. <em>Josephus Quercetanus</em>, that famous Chymist and Physician to
<em>Henry</em> the Fourth of <em>France</em>, tells us thus much: “The Contagion
of the Plague is not only contracted by the mediation of the air
and water, things in a manner universal, or from other things more
particular, as vestments, linnen, and other moveable things inquinated
by the attraction of pestiferous Atomes: But also by
the detestable Crafts, and Diabolical Arts of certain most wicked
persons, which we call poysoners, or witches, by means of which
they contemperate and mix certain poysons into the form of an
unguent, and use to rub some of it upon the handle of doors, so
that those that do but lightly touch them, are forthwith infected
with the Plague, this subtile poison forthwith creeping by the
pores of the skin into the extremities of the veins, is quickly communicated
to the heart, to which human industry can hardly administer
any remedy.” Unto which the Lord <em>Verulam</em> gives this cautious
attestation: <i><span lang="la">Pestem quoq; excitavit januarum, rimarum, aliorumq;
inunctio, non tam ex contactu, quam quod homini in more positum,
si quid humidi adhærescat digitis, naso illud admovere. Moneri
se patientur, apud quos ea inolevit consuetudo, ut præcaveant.</span></i>
<em>Johannes Wierus</em> a learned Physician, and a person of credit and
veracity, reciteth this History from <i><span lang="la">Antonius Sabellicus</span></i>, <em>Ennead.</em> 4.
<em>lib.</em> 4. This strange venefice or witchcraft, was practis’d at <em>Casal</em> in
the City of <em>Salassia</em>, a Region of <em>Italy</em>, in the year of our Lord
God 1536. “About forty persons men and women, amongst whom
there was one Hangman, had combined and sworn together, That
seeing the Plague had ceased that before did rage, they would
compound an unguent, with which the handles of the doors being
besmeared, they should be infected that touched those handles.
They did also prepare a Powder which being secretly sprinkled in
the Garments, should produce the Plague. The Villany lay hid
for some certain time, and many were taken away of such as were
joined in blood or affinity: Also money was given (as was said)
to the Poysoners, instead of inheritance. But when they had murthered
the Brother and only Son of one <em>Necus</em>, and that scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>others than the Masters of Families themselves, or their Sons, did
perish: And that also they had marked, that into what Houses
those Conspirators had insinuated themselves, that those for the
most part did perish into whose Houses they entred: but the Conspiracy
being found out, they were all put to death with most exquisite
torments. They also confessed, that they had determined
to kill all the Citizens upon a Festival day, by anointing the Seats,
and to that purpose they had prepared twenty Pots full of that
pernicious and hellish Ointment. And <em>Paracelsus</em> tells us, that at
St. <em>Vitum</em> and <em>Villacum</em>, certain of the Poyson-makers in the
time of a Plague, did take the Earth and Dust from the Graves
of those that had been buried, and did so prepare it with their
Magical Art, that they raised up a most cruel and raging Plague,
whereby many thousands of men were infected and slain.” But that
the manner of that preparation is by no means to be revealed. Those
that desire more satisfaction in this particular may have recourse to
that learned Treatise, <i><span lang="la">de Peste</span></i>, written by the learned and industrious
<em>Matthias Untzerus</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. But there is no where a more strange accident written, than
what is recorded in our own Annals in the year 1579. the nineteenth
year of the Reign of Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>, in these words: “The
4, 5, and 6. days of <em>July</em>, were the Assises holden at <em>Oxford</em>,
where was arraigned and condemned one <em>Rouland Jenkes</em> for his
Seditious Tongue, at which time there arose such a damp, that
almost all were smothered, very few escaped that were not taken
at that instant: The Jurors died presently: Shortly after died
Sir <em>Robert Bell</em>, Lord Chief Baron, Sir <em>Robert de Olie</em>, Sir <em>William
Babington</em>, M<sup>r</sup> <em>Weneman</em>, M<sup>r</sup> <i><span lang="la">De Olie</span></i>, High Sheriff M<sup>r</sup> <em>Davers</em>,
M<sup>r</sup> <em>Farcurt</em>, M<sup>r</sup> <em>Kirle</em>, M<sup>r</sup> <em>Pheteplace</em>, M<sup>r</sup> <em>Greenwood</em>, M<sup>r</sup> <em>Foster</em>,
Serjeant <em>Baram</em>, M<sup>r</sup> <em>Stevens</em>, &#38;c. There died in <em>Oxford</em> 300. persons,
and sickned there but died in other places 200. and odd,
from the sixth of <em>July</em> to the twelfth of <em>August</em>, after which day
died not one of that sickness, for one of them infected not another,
nor any one Woman or Child died thereof.” This is the punctual
relation according to our English Annals, which relate nothing
of what should be the cause of the arising of such a damp, just at
the Conjuncture of time when <em>Jenkes</em> was Condemned, there being
none before, and so it could not be a Prison Infection, for that
would have manifested it self by smell or by operating sooner. But
to take away all scruple, and to assign the true Cause, it was thus:
It fortuned that a Manuscript fell into my hands, collected by an
antient Gentleman of <em>York</em>, who was a great observer and gatherer
of strange things and facts, who lived about the time of this accident
happening at <em>Oxford</em>, wherein it is related thus: “That
<em>Rouland Jenkes</em> being imprisoned for treasonable words spoken
against the Queen, and being a Popish Recusant, had notwithstanding
during the time of his restraint, liberty sometimes to walk
abroad with a Keeper, and that one day he came to an Apothecary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>and shewed him a receipt which he desired him to make up; but
the Apothecary upon the view of it told him, that it was a strong
and dangerous receipt, and required some time to prepare it, but
also asked him to what use he would apply it? he answered to kill
the Rats that since his Imprisonment spoiled his Books; so being
satisfied he promised to make it ready. After a certain time he
cometh to know if it were ready, but the Apothecary said the
ingredients were so hard to procure that he had not done it, and
so gave him the receipt again, of which he had taken a Copy,
which mine Author had there precisely written down, but did
seem so horribly poysonous, that I cut it forth lest it might fall
into the hands of wicked persons. But after it seems he had got
it prepared, and against the day of his tryal had made a week or
wick of it (for so is the word, that is, so fitted, that like a Candle
it might be fired) which as soon as ever he was Condemned
he lighted, having provided himself a Tinder-box and Steel to
strike fire. And whosoever should know the ingredients of that
Wick or Candle, and the manner of the Composition, will easily
be perswaded of the virulency and venenous effects of it, and this
in him in regard of the use and end was meerly Diabolical, though
the agency and effects were meer natural.”</p>

<p class='c008'>6. It is very strange to consider what learned and grave Authors
have left recorded of the Ligation or binding of Husbands that they
might not be viripotent, or be able to have to do with their Wives
for a longer or a shorter time; nay some even have proceded so far as
to write it, and seem also to believe it; that by venifice or Witchcraft,
the virile members may be quite taken away; as is related by
<em>Codronchius</em>, of a certain young man that had his members quite
taken away by a Woman Witch, which notwithstanding she restored
again, by beating and putting her in the fear of death. And of this
incredible story, <em>Sennertus</em> a professed maintainer of the impossible
power of Witches, doth notwithstanding give this censure. “The
Devil doth often delude men by prestigious and jugling deceits,
and perswadeth them that he hath brought such Diseases as indeed
are none at all, as this taking away the virile member, related by
<em>Baptista Codronchius</em>. For although some be of that opinion, that
the genital members may really be taken away and restored by the
Devil: notwithstanding (he saith) I had rather hold with those
that believe such things are meer juglings and delusions; seeing
it is not in the power of the Devil to restore unto man a member
lost or taken away. The most learned Lord <em>Bacon</em> doth affirm,
that this kind of Ligation or binding, to make men impotent for
Coition, is frequent in <em>Santonne</em> and <em>Gascoigne</em>, and is used to be
done upon the Marriage day, and that it is often performed by
the Mothers to prevent that incantation by others, and that they
may loose it when they please. And doth think it no light matter
because punishable by their laws. And saith after, If it exceed
not nature it hath its force from the Imagination of the binder of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>the virile member,” and adds: <i><span lang="la">Putem ego illud ab incantatione
alienum esse, quia non à certis personis tantum (quales incantatores)
sed à quolibet fieri potest</span></i>. But that which puts it forth of all doubt
that it is nothing but melancholy, and the abuse of the fancy, is manifest
from the observation of perspicacious <em>Salmuth</em>, which is this:
“I have known two (he saith) who did imagine themselves impotent
to the act of Venery, and thought themselves maleficiated
or bewitched, when as before they had afforded themselves sufficiently
strenuous in that warfar also with their Wives. But
both being (he saith), handled and cured by me, as persons melancholick
and Hypochondriacal, have afterwards sufficiently
laughed at themselves. But I did conjecture them to be melancholick
by this, because they did complain, that about that act
they were overwhelmed with an heap of Cogitations. From
whence it is manifest from what cause that effect did proceed.
And therefore it is deservedly doubted of <em>Wierus</em>, whether or no
there be any true impotency at all, but what is from natural
Causes.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 7.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>7. That the most of those vomitings of strange things is only
caused from natural Causes, as poysonous Potions, Philters and
the like, is manifest by another example given us by that famous
Chymist and learned Physician of <em>Frisuiga</em> in <em>Bavaria</em>, <i><span lang="la">Martinus
Rulandus</span></i>, which is this: “<em>David Held</em> Student in the Arts about
the twentieth year of his Age did receive from a wicked Woman
Cakes, which he did eat, and departing from her forthwith
in the way he began to doat, and being brought home he began
to rage more, and fell into madness. And to help this madness
the Students came unto me and declare the insanity, the Philter
that he had taken, and his being infected or brought into that
madness by it, and desire some help against it. To oppose which
(he saith) I gave six Ounces of my <i><span lang="la">Aqua Benedicta</span></i>, which I
commanded straightway to be given him in the name of <em>Jesus</em>.
And this being taken soon after by vomiting he cast up the Philter,
or invenomed Cakes that he had swallowed, which being cast
upon the Earth, they did with the admiration of the by-standers
begin to wax hot and to boil, as meat with the fire doth grow
hot and boil. So that this poison being cast up as a thing unhoped
for, soon after the insanity is driven away, and within two days
his understanding was perfectly restored, and by the power of the
Almighty did totally recover.” So that it is manifest that these
kind of people that are commonly called Witches, are indeed (as
both the Greek and Latin names do signifie) Poysoners, and in respect
of their Hellish intentions are Diabolical, but the effects they
procure flow from natural Causes. If any require more ample
satisfaction in this point, they may find divers Histories recorded
in <em>Schenkins</em> his Observations, <em>lib.</em> 7. <i><span lang="la">de venenis</span></i>, to verifie this particular.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Injaculat. mod. intrand.</em> <em>p.</em> 603, 604.</div>

<p class='c008'>8. There is no one Argument that doth more confirm, that what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>effects soever Devils, or those called Witches do bring to pass in
humane bodies, are wrought by natural means, and proceed from
natural causes: Because what diseases soever are cured by natural
causes and agents, must of necessity be brought into humane bodies
by natural means. But many diseases attributed to the Devil,
or Witches as instruments, have been cured by natural means and
applications, as we shall prove both by authorities and matters of
fact. And therefore those diseases must of necessity grow and arise
from natural causes. And for authority we find <em>Helmont</em> affirming
thus much: “And also partly the curing of these diseases is to be
had by certain Simples, to which the omnipotent goodness hath
given a gift from the beginning of the Creation, of resisting,
preventing and correcting of <i><span lang="la">Veneficia</span></i>, Witchcrafts, or poysonings,
and of bringing forth things injected. For (he saith) certain
Simples do drive away evil spirits (a miserable company of
Men, who give worship to Gods, that are not able to resist the
natural efficacy of Simples) and reckons some that take away
the penetration of the formal light tied to the excrements. Some
do hinder the touch, entrance or application. And that there
are many such like, that do correct the poysons, and kill them.
And chiefly he commendeth the <i><span lang="la">Electrum minerale immaturum</span></i> of
<em>Paracelsus</em>, the <em>Phu</em> of <em>Dioscorides</em>, being a kind of Valerian with
purple flowers, and likewise there commemorateth diverse others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 9.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>To confirm this assertion of <em>Helmonts</em>, we shall transcribe what
the Honourable person Mr. <em>Boyle</em> hath set down to this purpose.
“Since the beginning of this Essay (he saith) I saw a lusty, and very
sprightful Boy, child to a famous Chymical Writer, (I judge
it to be <i><span lang="la">Joachimus Poleman</span></i>) who as his Father assured me and
others, being by some enemies of this Physicians, when he was yet
an infant, so bewitcht that he constantly lay in miserable torment,
and still refusing the breast, was reduced by pain and want of
food, to a desperate condition, the experienced relator of the
story remembring that <em>Helmont</em> attributes to the <i><span lang="la">Electrum minerale
immaturum Paracelsi</span></i>, the virtue of relieving those, whose
distempers come from Witchcraft, did according to <em>Helmonts</em> prescription
hang a piece of this noble mineral about the infants
neck, so that it might touch the pit of the Stomach; whereupon
presently the child, that could not rest in I know not how
many dayes and nights before, fell for a while asleep, and waking
well cried for the Teat, which he greedily suckt, from
thenceforth hastily recovering, to the great wonder both of the
Parents, and several others that were astonisht at so great and
quick a change. And though I am not forward (he saith) to
impute all those diseases to Witchcraft, which even learned Men
father upon it; yet it’s considerable in our present case, that whatsoever
were the cause of the disease, the distemper was very great,
and almost hopeless, and the cure suddenly performed by an outward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>application, and that of a Mineral, in which compacted sort
of bodies the finer parts are thought to be lockt up.” Another
example he giveth us in these words: “The same <em>Henricus ab
Heer</em> among his freshly commended observations, hath another
of a little Lady, whom he concludes to have been cast into the
strange and terrible distemper, which he there particularly records,
by Witchcraft. Upon so severe an examination of the
Symptomes made by himself in his own house, that if, notwithstanding
his solemn professions of veracity, he mis-relate them not,
I cannot wonder he should confidently impute so prodigious a
disease to some supernatural cause. But though the observation,
with its various circumstances, be very well worth your perusing;
yet that, for which I here take notice of it is, what he adds about
the end of it, concerning his having cured her, after he had in
despair of her recovery sent her back to her Parents, by an outward
medicine, namely, an Oyntment which he found extolled
against pains produced by Witchcraft, in a Dutch book of <em>Carrichter</em>’s
(where also I remember I met with it set down a little differently
from what he delivers.)”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. Medic.</em> 34. <em>p.</em> 127.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 10.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>But to conclude this tedious particular, I shall only add one observation
more from learned <em>Salmuth</em>, which is this: “The servant
Maid (he saith) of <em>Cæsars à Breitenbach</em> was taken with a
most intense pain of her left arm, which when it did not at all
remit or abate, but that the dolour was augmented more and
more, and that no tumour, nor any other preternatural thing did
outwardly appear, the beholders did fear some sort of venefice or
Witchcraft. Therefore they apply a well tryed medicine, which
in such a case is said to be much approved, to wit red Corals well
beaten with the leaves of Oak, and with Rose-water brought
into the form of a Cataplasm, and leave it on for the space of 24
hours. In which space of time the place is brought to suppuration,
and within as many more hours, the same remedy being applyed
again, the abscess is broken, and in it needles, hairs and burnt
coals are found. All these together with the Amulet they put
into an hole made with an Augur or Gimlet in the root of an
Oak, towards the East, in the morning before the Sun rise, and
they stopped up the same hole with a wedge or pin, made of the
wood of the same Tree. The pain thereupon plainly ceaseth,
and the place is with other medicaments brought to Cicatrization.
But some deriding such things, and thinking them to be
prestigious delusions, do pull them forth of the hole again. Hereupon
forthwith that miserable servant was again afflicted with
cruel pains, more raging than the former. Therefore they repeat
the former medicaments, and more copious matter doth issue
forth, which being taken together with the Amulet, and put in
the former place in the Oak, all the pains did forthwith vanish,
and she afterwards lived altogether sound.” And so I conceive
that by these reasons, authorities and instances of matters of fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>it is sufficiently proved, that what Devils or Witches work in humane
bodies or in corporeal matter, is by applying fit actives to
suitable passives, and so the effects are only produced by natural
causes and means, which was the thing I undertook to make good.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next thing that in this Chapter we have to consider and examine
is the opinion of <em>Johannes Baptista van Helmont</em>, that great
Physician, Philosopher and Chymist, which we shall open in these
particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. He reciteth a large Catalogue of things, that are in a most
strange manner brought or injected into the bodies of Men and Women,
as darts, thorn-pricks, or pins, chaff, hairs, dust of wood
that hath been sawed, little stones, egg-shels and pieces of pots,
hulls and husks or swads, insects, things of linen, needles and the
instruments of artificers, which have been injected insensibly, and
entred altogether in an invisible manner, but were detained and ejected
with direful pains and tortures. And that sometimes they
are greater than the holes or passages by which they are intromitted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. And to confirm this assertion he bringeth instances of matters
of fact, as these following. “For (he saith) of late there was a part
of an Oxe hide injected by the pores of the skin, it being intire,
which the Chirurgeon did draw forth with a pair of Forceps,
it being of the magnitude of the ball of a Mans hand, the
Apostume first being ripened. And a Witch burned at <em>Bruges</em>,
did confess, that she had injected that hide into the good
man. So (he saith) we have in times past seen at <em>Lira</em> the children
of <em>Orphans</em> to have cast up by vomit an artificial Horse and
Cart, drawn forth by the hands of the by-standers; to wit a
four footed board accompanied with its ropes, and wheel. And
what way soever it were placed, it was easily greater than the
double throat. Further he saith, I have seen at <em>Antwerp</em> in the year
1622. a young Maid, who had vomited, perhaps two thousand
pins conglomerated together, and with them hairs and filth. Another
Maid (he saith) at <em>Mechlin</em> in the year 1631, who we being
present, did vomit up shavings of wood or chips, cut off in
plaining with the Hatchet, with much slimy stuff, to the magnitude
of two fists. It is (he saith) a frequent thing every where
admitted by learned Men.” Upon which we will only give these
Animadversions.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. That things as strange as these, that <em>Helmont</em> seems to avouch
of his own sight and knowledge, are also attested by other persons
of great learning and credit, as, besides what we have immediately
before shewed from <em>Salmuth</em>, of the needles, hairs and burnt coals
that came forth of the Maids arm, these examples may ratifie. We
will pass by <em>Sprenger</em>, <em>Bodin</em>, <em>Remigius</em> and <em>Del Rio</em> as Pontificial
Authors, and therefore partial and interested, only in the first place
we shall give this from <em>Alexander Benedictus</em>, who telleth this:
“That he saw two Women his neighbours upon one day, being infected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>by potions of evil medicaments, who afterwards were
wonderfully tormented with strange vomitings: That the one
cast up with great strainings an head bodkin very great bended
like an hook, with a great lump of Womens hair, wrapped with
the pairing of nails, who died the day following. The other vomited
up a Womans Quoif, pieces of glass, with three dried
pieces of a Dogs tail that was hairy, so that she had voided
by vomiting as much, (if set together,) as would have equalized
the quantity of the whole tail. But the most strange story
that possibly can be read is recorded by <em>Thomas Bartholinus</em> who
was Physician to <em>Frederick</em> the third King of <em>Denmark</em>, of <em>Anna
Erici</em>, who vomited up at several times a piece of sharp wood,
great store of black blood, an hem or fring of silk or linen cloath
of a blew colour, sowed with a green thred, in which were hid
three pieces of lead, two pieces of glass, three Almonds, three
pieces of a Tobacco-pipe, and white stones or flints: And afterwards
many other horrid, strange and incredible things that may
be read in the place quoted in the Margent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Anim. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. It would seem a point of strange Scepticism or infidelity to
distrust and reject these relations as lies and fictions, seeing the
Authors that recite them do for the most part attest them upon their
own view or knowledge, or at least from unquestionable eye-witnesses,
and that they were Men of great Reputation and Credit,
that lived in several Countrys, and in different times, and therefore
could not conspire in a lie.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Anim. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. But notwithstanding all this, we find persons of great learning
and sober judgments, to use much hesitation about these things, and
either to suspend their belief of them, as having never seen any
such things themselves, and therefore may well conclude as many
Wise Men do, that he that hath seen a thing may better believe
it than he that hath not seen it, or else are utterly diffident and believe
no such matters of fact at all. And indeed there is no greater
folly than to be very inquisitive and laborious to find out the causes
of such a Phenomenon, as never had any existence, and therefore
Men ought to be cautious and be fully assured of the truth of the
effect, before they adventure to explicate the cause. And I find
both my Lord <em>Bacon</em>, and that honourable and learned person
Mr. <em>Boyle</em>, when they have occasion to mention these things, do it
with extream caution, and always with an If or some other note
of signal dubitation, and also the Lord <em>Mountaigue</em> in his Essays,
and our Countreyman Mr. <em>Osburne</em> (no contemptible persons) in
his writings seem utterly diffident of any such matter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Anim. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. Again if we consider how easy a thing it is, for the most vigilant,
attentive and wisest person either to impose upon himself,
being drawn by those overruling notions that he suckt in from his
childhood, whereby the will and affections being never so little
byassed the judgment will be presently swayed that way: or how
subject the most wary and perspicacious person is to be imposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>upon by the cunning craftiness or confederacy of others, or drawn
to believe a meer impossibility, by the perseverant asseverations of
what others have seen and known, may certainly induce us,
though not utterly to reject all relations of this nature, yet to stand
like <em>Janus</em> in this field of doubtful perplexity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Anim. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. If to this we add the consideration, how rare and seldome
these things happen, and how long (though it argue but negatively)
many Physicians have practised, and yet have never met with any
such strange accidents: and withal that many of these vomitings
of strange stuff, and the like have been meer counterfeit juglings
and Impostures, as was manifest in the Boy of <em>Bilson Sommers</em> of
<em>Nottingham</em> and diverse others: besides, I that have practised Physick
above forty years could never find any such thing in truth and
reality, but have known many that have counterfeited these strange
vomitings, and the like, which we and others have plainly laid
open and detected. So that though we shall not simply deny the
verity of these relations, so we cannot but believe, that some of
them have been cheats and delusions, and others meer mistakes
of ignorance and vain credulity, and in the belief of any of them,
that we ought to proceed with much cautiousness and careful foresight.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The next thing that <em>Helmont</em> lies down (after he thinketh
that he hath proved the matters of fact sufficiently) is the assigning
of the true cause (as he thinketh) of the bringing to pass these
wondrous effects; And these he maketh twofold, first the Devil,
by reason of the league with the Witch, doth bring and convey the
things to be injected to the place, or near the object; and makes
them invisible by his spiritual power: Secondly that the Witch by
the strength of her imagination and the motion of her free will,
(which he holds to be the only peculiar prerogative of mankind,
and to remain both with Men and Women after the fall, namely a
power by their free wills and force of imagination, to create or
frame seminal and efficacious Ideas to work as it were <i><span lang="la">ad nutum</span></i>)
doth convey or inject these strange things into the bodies of those
they would hurt or torment, and that in this case as the ultimate attempt
of nature, there is and may be a penetration of dimensions, and
these things he attempteth to prove after this manner, which we
shall first amply lay down and relate, and afterwards we shall give
some notes and observations upon them, as things of great weight
and consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>“1. He granteth that the evil spirit hath a power motive, yet
therewith cannot hurt the innocent as he pleaseth. And further
he tells us that these injected things do enter invisibly. And that
this one thing is meerly Diabolical. For the most miserable scoffer
(he saith) seeing he hath nothing that is real left to his liberty,
yet he hath vain appearances: Because he is the Father of lies, he
feigneth those things and maketh them to appear falsly, or otherwise
than they are, from the beginning of the World. And in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>these juglings the Man that is the Devils bondslave worketh nothing
at all. But by what manner the Devil maketh things visible
in themselves to be invisible, or how he involves them in his
invisible spirit, he confesseth that he is not a sedulous searcher
of the works of Satan, that belong unto him in propriety. And
therefore that the Devil doth transfer the things to be injected,
being made invisible, unto the object, the Idea of humane desire
directing. And because it is not permitted to the Devil, to
enter into Man, much less that he may hurt him, and least of all
with an invisible burden; therefore he useth the free motive
power of the Man bound unto him. The Man doth therefore
impress his free motive Blas into the body made invisible, but
the Devil doth carry it unto the Man, into whom it is to be injected.
And as a knife by the desire and consent of the person
wounding is fixed into the flesh of him that is wounded: So this
body made invisible by the Devil, is injected into the body of
the person to be inchanted, by the Idea of the motive power of
the Witch: Satan conspiring to this because of the purposed direction
of hurting the person.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Truly I believe (he saith) that it doth fight with Piety, if a
power exceeding nature be attributed to the Devil. As though
Satan should be above nature, and should operate things impossible
to nature. I grant that the manner is exotick and strange,
but yet notwithstanding it ought to be contained within the limits
of nature. And if it be said: the manner is unknown by
which nature should do it. The manner is also equally unknown
by what means Satan should do it. Therefore they gain nothing
who refer the work of nature unto the Devil. But whether they
offend or not, let others look to it. For at least it is an invention
of immense sloathfulness, to refer all things to the Devil that
we do not understand. Neither would I (saith he) have the Devil
called upon to satisfie our questions by a temerarious attribution
of power.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. “Therefore (he saith) I will shew, that the aid of Satan is
not at all needful, that some solid body may be drawn without
the comminution of it self, by a passage far less than it self. For
the evil spirit, though he have a motive Blas; yet notwithstanding
it is against piety, that he can hurt the innocent at his pleasure.
Which certainly should come to pass, if every where he
could inject these things, according to his nefarious will, for (he
saith) I have seen these things happen to innocent children, to
Virgins that were pious and devoted to God after a singular manner.
And to prove this point he giveth these instances. <em>Cornelius
Gemma de Cosmocriticis</em> doth recite that he had seen a piece
of three pounds or 48. ounces weight, of a brass Cannon, which
a Maid the Daughter of a Cooper had voided by stool, with its
characters or letters, together with an Eele wrapt in its secundines.
But it is impossible to nature to melt powdered metal in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>us, and to be detained so many months in its pristine figure in the
Intestines, or that the Eele should so often be made into small powder
and to arise again from death. And that pieces of wood and
leather should so often be turned into small powder, and again
restored into their former condition. For (he saith) I have seen
at <em>Bruxells</em> in the year 1599. that an Oxe having taken three
Herbs did vomit a Dragon with a tail like an Eele, a body as of
leather, a Serpentine Head, and not less than a Partridge. There
is (he saith) an History of a Polonish Countryman, seen lately
of the Son of the Lord <i><span lang="la">Ericius Puteanus</span></i>. A certain rustick did
attempt himself to cut the Squinsie that he had in his throat with
a short Knife, which at unawares he swallowed, and that at the
length he did void the same at the right side of the <em>Abdomen</em>, or
lower belly, with much rotten matter after great tortures, and
survived in health. Also at <em>Vilvordia</em> in the year 1636. a Countryman
known unto me (he saith) intending to feed a Cow, did
daily give her a bowl, in which he had boiled Pot-Herbs with
bran. At last she waxeth leaner more and more every day, and begun
to halt upon the right thigh: The Cow being killed, the short
Knife of his Wives bended back into the haft of Box, is found
hid betwixt the ribs and the shoulder blade: For the Country
Woman in cutting the rape root, had left her Knife amongst the
Pot-Herbs, and the Cow by drinking had swallowed it. Also (he
saith) <em>Ambrosius Paræus</em> relateth a story of a certain man whom
Thieves had compelled to swallow a Knife, which he afterwards
being sound did void by an Apostume of the side. <em>Alexander Benedictus</em>
(he saith) doth mention another, to whom an Arrow
had penetrated into his back, the hook of which of the breadth
of three fingers he did void by stool without hurt. The same
Author relateth of a certain Girl of <em>Venice</em> who had swallowed
a Needle, and that after two years she voided it by urine, crusted
over with a stony substance. Also (he saith) <i><span lang="la">Antonius Benevenius</span></i>
doth relate, that an Hetruscan Woman had swallowed a Copper
Needle or Pin, which three years after she voided at the Navil,
and was sound. <em>Valesius de Taranta</em> (he saith) mentioneth
a Girl of <em>Venice</em> (perhaps the same) who voided by urine a Pin
of three fingers long. A certain Capucine at <em>Eburum</em> called <em>Bullonius</em>,
by Sirname <em>Hamptean</em>, did with much aversion of mind
drink up an huge living Spider, which he had seen fall into the
Chalice in the time of the Sacrifice of the Mass. Within a few
days he had a Phlegmon or bile that did arise in his right thigh,
and with much rotten matter from thence he voided the whole
Spider, but being dead. A young Merchant of <em>Antwerp</em> being
playing at <em>Venice</em> in his mouth with an unripe Ear of Barley, did
swallow the same with an huge fear of suffocation: From thence
after three Weeks in the left side above the Girdle, an Apostume
appeared, and at the length with the rotten matter the same Ear
of a yellow colour is extracted whole. And he escaped sound.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>With <em>Fernelius</em> a Student is related to be cured by him who had
voided an Ear of Corn by the ribs. Also Writers do commemorate,
that the young one sometimes dead and wasted in the Womb,
hath voided the bones through the Womb, the belly, by the navil,
and sometimes by the fundament. More things of this nature
do every where occur amongst Authors worthy of credit.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. From which matters of fact he thus concludeth: “By which
(he saith) it is manifest, that solid bodies sufficiently great, have
penetrated the Stomach, the Bowels, the Womb, the Caul, the
lower Belly, the skin upon the inside of the Ribs, the Bladder,
Membranes (he saith) impatient of so great a wound. That is
to say, that Knives have been transmitted through these Membranes
without wound, which is equivalent to the penetration
of dimensions made in nature without the help of the Devil. And
that an human body may be drawn through a small hole, through
which a Cat might only pass, but not through a Wall. Verily
that the Devil cannot break a paper Window without the consent
of his Master, is (he saith) manifest by the process and arrest of
<em>Ludovicus Godfredus</em> the Witch, pronounced at <em>Aix</em> in <em>Narbona</em>,
the last of <em>April 1611</em>. I pray you where have the three pounds
of brass, of the Cannon of War, marked with its letters, laid hid?
how for so many months hath the dross shined, in what part was
the piece of brass greater than the intestine contained? While I
was (he saith) shewing a necessary vacuity in the air, I promised
that I would declare, that although the penetration of bodies by
the primary law of nature, and by the common way of Artificers
be forbidden: notwithstanding that while a body doth totally
pass over into the dominion of the spirit, and is carried over, and
is by that as it were weakened; then bodies do naturally and mutually
penetrate one another, at least in that part that is porous:
Because that the spirit then doth inclose the body under it self,
and therefore as it were taketh away the dimensions.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 5.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. And to confirm and open this point more fully, he saith:
“I will premise some things. The desire of eating Muscles did invade
a Woman with Child. And she eateth some of them so very
hastily, that she did devour the raw shells, twice or thrice broken
with her teeth. Thereupon by and by within an hour, she bringeth
forth a sound and adult Child, with the same half-chewed shells,
and wounded in the belly. Therefore the shells without the aperture
of the membranes, had forthwith penetrated the Stomach,
Womb and Secundines: or else there were new shells generated
upon the young Child. Neither could this later be true. For they
were the true fragments of the Muscles, and not figuratively framed
to the imitation of them. Furthermore, the appetite is not
carried to a thing unknown: Therefore the appetite of eating
the Muscles was not of the Child, but of the Woman. Therefore
it was not necessary that new Muscles should be generated about
the Child; for they were desired by the Mother that they might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>become nutriment to her, not the Child. Otherwise by the same
argument of Identity, what things soever should by the appetite
be desired, should be generated about the young Child; of whom
when they could not be digested, they should be always either
left remaining about the Child, or should there putrefie. Which
is false both ways: for if it should putrefie, that which is desired
would cause abortion; or if it were conserved there, it would be
found regularly. For the Child is only nourished by the Navil:
Therefore those external Muscles could neither be wished by the
Child, nor could be profitable unto it, and by consequence,
were neither for an end made anew, but sent to the young one by
reason that it was an uterine appetite. The appetite is always directed
from the end; but the Woman with Child desired the
Muscles not the shells, neither that the Muscle being a living animal
might remain in its former state, in which it was unprofitable
to the Mother, nor could satisfie her appetite; and therefore much
less hath had occasion of generating new and unprofitable shells
about the young one. But however it be taken, the appetite was
not to the shells twice or thrice broken. For if the Fishes had been
taken forth of the shells, she had eaten the fish the shells being left.
Therefore the concomitance and concision of the shells were accidental
to the appetite. I suppose truly (he saith) that as the desire,
terrour, <em>&#38;c.</em> do generate seminal Idea’s, which the hand of
the Woman with Child doth send down to the young one, and
doth depinge or figurate it in a set time: So the joy of finding
that which the appetite did desire, doth bring that very thing to
the Child. So verily the heaviness of heart of him that swallowed
the Knife, the horror of having drunk the Spider, and of the Ear
of Barley devoured, did repel or drive back those things beyond
the membranes not able to suffer a wound without death. And
these things (he saith) of things injected, entring by the ordinary
power of nature, without the suspicion of Diabolical cooperation.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>6. Now he proceedeth to prove penetration of dimensions by
natural power in another way. “Something like to these (he saith)
appeareth in things that from within are to without taken away,
which I will dispatch (he saith) in one or two examples. The
Wife of a Taylor of <em>Mechlinia</em>, seeth a Souldier before the doors
to lose his hand in a conflict: Forthwith being stricken with
horror, she brought forth a Daughter with one hand, the other
awanting, with the stump all bloody, which hand of hers could
not be found, and the flux of blood killed the Child. The Wife
of <em>Marke de Vogeler</em>, a Merchant of <em>Antwerpe</em> in the year 1602.
seeing a Souldier begging whose right Arm an Iron Bullet in the
Siege of <em>Ostend</em> had taken away, and which he carried about as
yet bloody; by and by after that she brought forth a Daughter
wanting an Arm, and that the right one too, the shoulder of whom
being yet bloody the Chirurgion ought to consolidate. She hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Married to a Merchant of <em>Amsterdam</em>, by name <em>Hoochcamer</em>; and
is yet living this year 1638. But the right Arm was no where to
be found, neither the bones or any corruption did appear, into
which the Arm might be wasted in a little hour. But the Souldier
not being seen, the Child had two Arms, neither could the Arm
that was torn off be annihilated. Therefore the Womb being shut
the Arm was taken away. But who tore it away naturally, and
whither was it taken? certainly trivial reasons do not square or
agree in so great a portent or Paradox. I am not he that will say
these things. I will say this at the least: That the Arm was not
taken away or torn off by Satan. Furthermore it was of less weight
to carry away elsewhere the Arm torn off, than to have torn
the Arm from the whole body without death. The Wife of a Merchant
(he saith) known unto us, as soon as she heard that thirteen
were to be beheaded (it happened at <em>Antwerpe</em> in the time of
the Duke of <em>Alva</em>) and Women with Child are led with inordinate
appetites, she determined to see the decollations. Thereupon
she ascends the Chamber of a Widdow that was a familiar friend
to her that lived in the Market-place. And the spectacle being
seen, forthwith the pain of Child-birth took her, and she brought
forth a full grown infant with a bloody neck, whose head did no
where appear.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 7.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>7. From these most stupendious and almost incredible stories, he
draweth these conclusions. “I do not find (he saith) that human
nature doth abominate the penetration of dimensions, seeing it is
most frequent to the seeds of things. For in the seeds of things,
that primevous Energie of penetrating bodies, doth yet consist, but
not subject to force, art or human arbitrement. For there are many
bodies many times more ponderous than the matter of which
they are framed. It is necessary (he saith) that more than fifteen
parts of water do fall in together into one, that one part of gold
may from thence be made. For weight is not made of nothing:
but argueth the ponderating matter in the ballance. Therefore
water doth naturally penetrate its body so often as the gold doth
overweigh the water. Therefore the domestick and daily progress
of seeds in Generations, doth require that the body doth penetrate
it self by condensation, which is altogether impossible to an Artificer.
We grant (he saith) that there are pores in the water,
these notwithstanding cannot contain so much as fourteen times
the quantity of its whole. Therefore it is ordinary, that some
parts of the water do penetrate themselves into one place.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 8.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>8. And to illustrate this going before he saith: “By an example,
<i><span lang="la">Aqua fortis</span></i> doth by its spirit make Brass, Iron or Silver remaining
opacous in their natures so transparent that they cannot be
seen, and doth pass the metal thorough filtring paper, which
otherwise will not transmit, no not the most small powder, which
metal doth essentially remain still a metal <i><span lang="la">in specie</span></i> or kind. But
not that the similitude of penetration of dimensions doth uniformly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>square with the propounded example of the metal. Because reasons
do not agree to so great a Paradox, wherein (he saith) I
willingly acknowledge the manner to be indemonstrable <i><span lang="la">à priori</span></i>.”
Even as no man can know by what means the Idea impressed in the
seeds doth figurate, direct, and dispose the things that it hath
framed. And therefore we are forced to hunt forth the same <i><span lang="co">à
posteriori</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 9.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>9. From all which he draweth this Conclusion. “There is therefore
another far different power of incantation, besides the Devils.
And therefore natural and free. He hath no Dominion over the
just. But if the power of inchanting were free to the Devil, also
it would be equally free to him to kill by a Knife or a Maul. And
so none should be free. Therefore the Witch (he saith) doth,
<i><span lang="la">per ens naturale</span></i>, form imaginatively a free Idea, which is natural
and noxious. Which Idea Satan cannot form. Because that the
formation of Idea’s do require the Image of God and a free power:
And therefore the Witches do operate by a natural force, no less
against the just and innocent, than against wicked men. Seeing
that inchantments do more easily infect Children than those of ripe
age, sooner Women than stout Men: A certain natural power is
signified to be limited to the inchantment, to which it is easily
resisted by a stout and couragious mind. The Devil therefore
offereth filth and poysons to his Clients, that he may knit fermentally
Idea’s formed in the Imagination of the Witches unto them.
And he preserveth that Ideal poyson, that it may not be blown
away with the wind, or being covered in the earth, it be not destroyed
by putrefaction. But he carrieth that poison locally near
to the object, to be inchanted: But to apply it, or carry it into
the man, he by no means is able. And therefore the Witch
doth also send forth another <em>executive medium</em>, or mean emanative
and commanding, which mean is the Idea of a strong desire.
For it is inseparable to the desire to be carried about things wished
for. To all which the Devil as a Spectator doth assist in the
conduction.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 10.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>10. “For (he saith) in truth, I have demonstrated already, that
operative means are solely in the power of man. For only God is
the most chiefly glorious Creator, to be infinitely praised, who
hath Created the Universe forth of nothing. But man as far forth as
he is the Image of God doth forth of nothing create certain <i><span lang="la">Entia
rationis</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la">non</span></i>-Entities in their beginning, and that in the proper
gift of the Phantastical virtue. Which are notwithstanding
something more than meerly a privative or negative being. For
first of all while these conceived <em>Idea</em>’s do at length cloath themselves
in the species or shape fabricated by the Imagination, they
become Entities now subsisting in the middest of that Vestment,
to which by the whole they are equally in them. And thus far
they are made seminal and operative Entities: of which, to wit
their assumed subjects are forthwith totally directed. But this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>power is given to man alone. Otherwise a seminal power to propagate,
is given to the Earth, to Bruits, Plants, <em>&#38;c.</em> Also the Dog
by his madness can transfer or change his spittle or <em>saliva</em> into
poyson, because it is peculiar to his kind or species. Which also
is obvious in divers poysons of animals. But to form Idea’s abstracted
from their species and adjacent proprieties, that is given
to none but man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Having thus far at large traced his footsteps in these abstruse and
mysterious matters, we shall come now to examine them and make
some observations upon them. And although we may be sharply
censured for taking upon us to question the things that he hath
asserted, having been <em>suo gradu</em> an Adeptist, a person of profound
judgment, great experience, general learning, high reputation, and
now generally followed as the Chief Standard-bearer for Philosophy,
Physick and Chymistry, that many esteem it no small glory
to be called and accounted an Helmontian. Yet notwithstanding
this we shall note some observations in this order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Incant.</span></i> <em>p.</em> 677.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. He holdeth that the Devil doth only make the things invisible,
or hides them by his spirit, and brings them near to the object
into which they are to be injected, and that the Witch by the seminal
Idea of her imagination, and the strength of her desire as
the agent, or efficient cause, doth inject or thrust them into the
body of the person, intended to be hurt or tormented; whereby he
necessarily supposes a league or contract betwixt the Devil and the
Witch, and therefore he calls them the Devils clients and those
that are bound unto him. But what kind of contract this should
be, explicite or implicite, internal and mental, or corporeal and
visible, he tells us not; the latter of which we utterly deny, that it
is in the power of the Devil to practise when he pleaseth, as we
have before with sufficient arguments demonstrated at large. And
for an implicite or mental league, we grant that all thieves, murderers,
these kind of malicious and poysoning Witches and all other
wicked persons are bound in a spiritual contract unto him: For
he is the spirit that <em>worketh in the children of disobedience</em>.
And what wickedness soever he hath tempted and drawn them unto,
to be willing to commit, he prompteth and pusheth them on
with all his skill and power to perpetrate and execute the same.
But still this is to be understood only of his spiritual and invisible
assistance, and not of any visible or corporeal aid, for else (as this
Author confesseth) he might as well kill with a knife or a maul.
And therefore we cannot here pass by the bold and groundless (if
not impious) assertion of <em>Sennertus</em>, who though a very learned
person in diverse parts of humane literature, yet drawn with
the sway of popular opinion, did most miserably lapse in affirming that
although Witches do purpose to hurt men, yet “that they neither
do nor can effect those things, but that the Witches being cast into
a profound sleep, the Devil in the mean time acteth those things
by himself; and thinks he proves this sufficiently by a fabulous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and lying story feigned to be told of a Witch, that being in a
deep sleep, when she waked, told that she had been transformed
into a Wolf, and had torn in pieces a Cow and a Sheep,” which
were found to be so, and therefore the Devil must needs have
done it. But in this he neither nameth the place, time, nor Author
to avouch it, and therefore all reasonable Men may judge how palpable
a falsity it is, for then if true it would follow that none could
be safe, and that the Devil might kill immediately with swords or
knives, which he cannot do.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Lithias.</span></i> <em>c.</em> 8. <em>p.</em> 75.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Whereas he holdeth that the Devil doth bring or convey the
things to be injected near unto the place, and that he offereth filth
and poysons to his clients, that thereby he may fermentally conjoin
the Ideas of these formed in the imaginative faculty with these.
If the Devil be taken to be meerly and simply incorporeal, then he
cannot remove matter (as we have before proved) and so cannot
convey the things near to the object; and if he be taken to be corporeal
(as we have asserted) his help is needless, because the Witches
may do it themselves, as we find sufficient stories of their hideing
of strange and poysonous things under the thresholds of houses
and Churches; and to this purpose this same Author telleth us this
story: “A certain person (he saith) did by custome use to make
water in a corner of the Court, whereupon he was afflicted with
a bloody and cruel Strangury. And all the remedy of the Physicians
proved in vain, except that as often as he did drink of Birch-Ale
he did find a signal ease: But as oft as he rose and walked,
and made water in the same place, so often his pains did return.
At the last a pin of old black Oak-wood is espied to be fixed in
the place where he used to make water. Which being pulled
forth and burned he remained free from the bloody Strangury, by
drinking Ale of Birchen-twiggs. Also (he saith) that he remembred,
that <em>Karichterus</em> had written that he had loosed such
kind of inchantments by only pissing through Beesomes of Birch.”
Now from hence it is plain that this making water constantly upon
this pin of old black Oak-wood did cause his bloody Strangury,
and that the pulling of it up and burning of it, was with the
help of the Birchen Ale the cure; but it can no wayes be judged
necessary that the Devil should fix the Oak pin there, but that the
Witch might do it himself. Neither can it be thought to be any
power given by the Devil to the Oaken pin, that it had not by
nature, for in probability it will constantly by a natural power
produce the same effect; only thus far the Devil had a hand in the
action, to draw some wicked person to fix the pin there where the
Man was accustomed to make water, thereby to hurt and torture
him, and so was only evil in respect of the end.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. We observe and affirm that whatsoever effects are brought
to pass by that which is commonly called and accounted Witchcraft,
if they be not brought to pass by jugling, confederacy, delusion
and imposture (as the most of them are, if not all) then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>they are performed either by meer natural causes, or the strength of
the Witches fancy, and most vehement desire of doing of mischief to
those she hateth, or by both joined together, and that Satan is
no further an author or actor, but as he leadeth and draweth the
minds of the Witches to do such mischievous actions, and pusheth
on to seek about to learn of others such secret poysons, charms,
images and other hidden things, that being used so or so, may produce
such destructive ends as their wicked and diabolical purposes
are led to, and in this sense they are his clients, and bounden vassals,
and not otherwise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. The stories that he relateth are either all to be taken to be
true, or none of them; and if they be all alike equally to be credited,
then it will undeniably follow, that they were all alike produced
by natural causes, and so no need at all of the Devils assistance
in performing of them, no more than by working upon the
minds of such as used those natural means to a wicked and mischievous
end. For first he giveth these instances of things that were
very strange that were voided either by vomit or stool, by the
ordinary power of nature, without suspicion of diabolical cooperation,
as the voiding of the piece of the brass Cannon with its
letters, with the Eele wrapped in its secundines: The Dragon that
the Oxe voided by taking three herbs, with a tail like an Eele, a
body like or of leather, with a Serpentine head, and not less than
a Partridge: The knife that the Thieves forced a man to swallow,
which he voided by an Apostume in the side, and was after sound:
also the arrow head of three fingers broad strucken into the back,
and after voided by stool, with diverse such which we recited before.
And that these being solid bodies should have penetrated
and passed through parts that are impatient of wounds, and in
which a wound is mortal, must of necessity be very wonderful, and
might as soon and upon as rational grounds be taken to be diabolical,
as those that he enumerateth to be so: For from these it
is manifest that either nature put to her last pinch doth make penetration
of dimensions, or else so inlarge the pores, that those solid
bodies may pass without wound, which (if seriously considered)
is a stupendious operation and effect. And as there needeth no
cooperation of a diabolical power, for the performing of these, no
more needeth there any concurrence of Devils to the others, that to
that purpose he relateth. Only here is all the difference: these are
wrought by the ultimate endeavour of the <em>Archæus</em> to save life;
without the concurrence of external causes; the others (that are
therefore called diabolical) are commonly wrought for a bad end,
namely to hurt or to take away life, and have an external cause, to wit,
the force of the Witches imagination and strong desire of doing of
mischief, which is stirred up to that end by Satan, and therefore in
regard of the end are devilish, though they be both wrought by the
agency of nature, the one in the body of the imaginant, the other
in the body that the Witch intendeth to hurt by the force of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>imagination and vehement desire, whereby a seminal Idea is created
or formed, which is sufficiently operative to accomplish the
end intended.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 5.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Syl. Syl.</em> <em>Cent.</em> 10. <em>p.</em> 556.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. The arguments that he bringeth to prove penetration of dimensions
to be in nature, or something equivalent thereunto, seem
to be strong and convincing. For in the generation of things,
whosoever shall seriously and strictly mark, shall find (as he alledgeth)
that the spirit of the Archeus (though not altogether incorporeal)
doth in the seeds of things penetrate it self, and their parts
one another, which he further maketh good by the instance of Gold
generated of water; for it must of necessity be, that more than fifteen
parts of water must fall in or penetrate one another, that from thence
one part of Gold may be made, for weight is not of nothing, but
argueth the matter ponderous in the Ballance. Therefore naturally
the water must so oft penetrate its body as the Gold doth
preponderate the water. And though it be granted that the water
hath pores, yet notwithstanding it cannot contain so much as
fourteen times, it whole. And therefore he irrefragably concludeth:
<i><span lang="la">Est ergo ordinarium in natura, quod aliquæ partes aquæ se penetrent
in unicum locum</span></i>. And this he backs with an unanswerable
story of a Woman that longing for Muscles, did in greediness eat
some of them with the shells twice or thrice broken with her teeth,
and that she brought forth a child with the same half eaten shells,
and a wound in the belly; therefore those shells had penetrated the
stomach, womb and secundines, or otherwise the force of the Archeus
had opened the pores and letten them pass in an unconceiveable
manner. So that if these things be granted to be true (and we
confess we know not how they can be answered) then there need
no diabolical power be brought to solve the injecting of strange
things into mens bodies, seeing nature is sufficient of it self, and
therefore we can allow no power at all unto Devils in effecting
these things (if they be truly done, and be not delusions) but only
in drawing the minds of the Witches to these wicked and mischievous
courses; and therefore the Lord <em>Bacon</em> said profoundly
and wisely these words: <i><span lang="la">Ut in operationibus illis earumq; causis
error cavendus est, ita quoq; danda vel imprimis opera est, ne effecta
nobis imponant, temere judicantibus talia esse, quæ eousq; nondum
processerunt. Sic prudentes judices, præscripta velut norma, fidem
haberi temere nolunt confessionibus sagarum, nec etiam factorum
contra illas probationi. Sagas enim turbat imaginationis vertigo,
ut putent se illud facere, quod non faciunt, populumq; hîc ludit credulitas,
ut naturæ opera imputent fascino.</span></i></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 6.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>6. And to confirm this point he addeth far more stupendious
matters of fact than the former, of things that were within, being
taken to without or invisibly conveyed away, as the woman at
<em>Mechlin</em> that saw the Souldier in a conflict lose his hand, and
forthwith brought forth a Daughter wanting an hand, which was
never found, and the wench died of the Hæmorrhage. Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>at <em>Antwerpe</em> seeing a Souldier begging with his right arm shot off and
bloody, forthwith brought forth a Daughter wanting the right
arm whose bloody shoulder the Chirurgeon cured, and she was married
after; and that the arm was never found, neither did there appear
any bones or putrefied matter into which the arm might waste.
Also another Woman going to see the Decollation of thirteen men;
did soon after bring forth a mature Child with a bloody neck, the
head no where appearing. I confess it would rack the judgment
even of the most credulous to the highest pitch to believe these
unparallel’d Stories; but the Author relating them as of his own
knowledge, and being a person of unquestionable veracity, I cannot
conceive how they can rationally be denied, especially finding
M<sup>r</sup> <em>Boyle</em> to affirm, that in those experiments (much more relations
of matters of fact) that <em>Helmont</em> avouched upon his own knowledge,
he durst be his Compurgator. Who would not believe but
that these things could never have been done, but by a supernatural
and Diabolical power, but that this Author (to which all judicious
persons in reason may adhere) doth utterly deny, that the arm
was either pull’d away or conveyed none can tell whither, by
Satan, and therefore that in such a strange Paradox, trivial reasons
are not to be allowed; and it were too much sloathfulness to ascribe
all effects unto Satan, of which we are ignorant. And therefore if
an hand, an arm, nay an whole head, could be separated from the
rest of the body, and conveyed forth of the Womb by the <em>Archeus</em>
or natural spirit, thereunto excited by the impression of horror and
terror in the Women: In like manner by the same power of the
natural spirit of man or woman, excited by a vehement and fierce
imagination to revenge and to do mischief, may strange things be
injected (if there can be any sound proof of such a matter of fact)
into the bodies of such men or women as the Witches intend to do
hurt unto, and yet Satan hath no more hand in it, but only as a
spiritual agent to move the wills of those wicked and malicious
people to do mischief unto those that they hate, though without
cause. And the great secret of that which may be called Witching,
is the learning of others, who likewise have had it by tradition,
the great force of imagination, and the natural spirit with the ways
and means how to excite it and exalt it; herein stands the mystery
of all Magick, and it becomes only evil in the use and application,
and they are to be condemned that use it to such devillish ends,
even as those that use those good Creatures that nature doth produce
to poysonous, wicked, and destructive purposes. And lastly,
here we may note, that if things or bodies that are without may
be injected into the bodies of others, by the force of exalted, imagination
and a vehement desire, then the same power that doth inject
them through skin, flesh and bones, must also be able to bring
them near to the place, and need not at all the assistance of Satan,
because it is far easier to carry them near the place, than to thrust
them into the body; and so this Author hath here introduced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Devils aid to bring them to the place to no purpose, and never
yet proved either by reason or matter of fact, that ever Satan did
any such thing, and so is a meer supposition without proof.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>7. The other matters of fact that he relateth are prodigious,
and are brought to prove that Satan is an actor to convey these
strange things into the bodies of men, and are these. A piece of
an Oxe Hide taken forth of a mans Arm, so also that <i><span lang="la">Equuleum</span></i>, a
Wood-Horse, or a four-footed board with a wheel and ropes twice
as broad as the gullet. Another that vomited up perhaps two thousand
pins conglomerated together, with filth and hairs; another that
vomited up, he being present, wooden Chips that had been cut off
with the Hatchet in smoothing of wood, with much slime to the
bigness of two fists, of which we shall note these Conclusions. 1. It
doth no way appear (if these things be granted to be true, both
for matter and manner) neither doth he offer to prove it, that
these are any more than the former Diabolical, but only in the
end, because they are for the hurt and destruction of mankind
and not otherwise; and there being no proof of the Devils Cooperation
any further but in working upon the minds of those
that are agents and instruments to bring these things to pass, we
may very well reject those things that are supposed, but not proved.
2. The ejecting or voiding of such strange things as here
he hath related, doth not necessarily suppose their injection
or thrusting in, because they may be bred there by natural Causes,
so Worms of many sorts and strange Figures, also Frogs, <em>Dracunculos</em>
and Askers have been voided, and doubtlesly bred there by
natural causes, and were not injected or thrust in, and for proof of
this I refer the Reader to the relations of learned <em>Schenchius</em> <em>lib.</em>
3. <em>p.</em> 363. of those strange sorts of Worms and other Creatures that
he from divers Authors sheweth have been vomited up, which without
all scruple, were not injected, but bred there. To confirm this
and to prove what strange things are sometimes bred in Apostumes
and Tumors, we shall translate a passage or two, and first take this
from <em>Levinus Lemnius</em> that learned and famous Physician of <em>Zeland</em>,
who writeth thus: “Also forth of sordid Ulcers and Impostures
(he saith) we have known that the fragments of nails, hairs,
shells, little bones and stones have been taken forth; which were
concreted and grown together forth of putrid humours: As also
little creatures, worms with tails, and little beasts of an unaccustomed
form, cast up by vomiting, especially in those who were
oppressed with contagious diseases, in whose urines I have often
discerned to swim little Animalcles like to Pismires, or to those
creatures we observe in the estival months to move in the celestial
dew here in <em>England</em> we call it Woodsoar, or Cuckow-spittle.”
Take another from that learned and expert Chirurgeon
<em>Ambrosius Paræus</em> where he is speaking of strange tumors, in these
words: “Also in these tumors being opened thou maist see bodies
of all kinds, and far differing from the common matter of Tumors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>as stones, chalk, sand, coals, cockles, ears of corn, hay,
horn, hairs, flesh as well hard as spongious, grisles, bones and
whole Animalcles, as well living as dead. The generation of
which things (by the corruption and alteration of the humors)
will not much astonish us, if we consider, that even as nature hath
framed Man as a Microcosm forth of all the seeds and elements
of the whole great world, that he might be as it were the lively
image of that great world: So in that Microcosm, nature
hath willed, that all the species of all motions and actions
might be manifest, nature being never idle in us, as long as matter
is not a wanting to work upon.” So that it is most plain that
these strange things may be bred within, and so the opinion of injecting
them, is but a meer figment. 3. Neither can the vomiting up
of such strange things as he relateth, conclude necessarily that they
were injected either by the power of Satan or the Witch, because
they may be performed by jugling, sleight of hand, confederacy
and the like, as was manifest in the Boy of <em>Bilson</em>, and diverse
that we have known, that had made some numbers of others to
believe that they had voided strange things, as pins, needles,
crooked-knitting-pricks, moss, nails, and the like; but upon a strickt
search, have but proved delusions and sleight, such as our common
<em>Hocus Pocus</em> Men use, when they make the people believe they
swallow a long pudding of white tinn, and again pull it forth of their
mouths, or in pulling ribbins, or laces of diverse colours forth of
their throats. 4. And again the most of these relations are but
commonly taken upon trust from the affirmations of the by-standers
who might be confederate parties, or ignorant persons, and so
easily deceived; and it appeareth not that <em>Helmont</em> was by at the
very instant when the children vomited up the wooden horse, or
four-footed board, but that it was the by-standers that drew it
forth, who might be parties to the cheat, or be themselves deluded,
and so aver it pertinaciously to others. For I have in my practice
known a young Wench about 9 or 10 years old, who that she
might be pittied and have an idle life, had made her Father and
Mother believe that quick worms came forth at her ear, and also I
taking her into mine own house she had perswaded all the family
that it was true, and did often open her head-cloaths, and holding
down her ear a quick worm would drop forth of the hair, who
notwithstanding by diligent watching, was found out to get them
privately from under stones or wood, and so did cunningly
convey them into her hair, but being discovered, was by due correction
reclaimed, and so the wonder ceased. And it is as common
to mistake things, either by absolute judging them to be such a
thing indeed, when it hath but some slender resemblance of it, or
by judging a thing to be really so, because of such a name but metaphorically
given unto it; so it is usual to call a <em>Carcinoma</em> in the
highest degree <em>Lupus</em> or a Wolf, because as a Wolf is a most voracious
creature, so this ulcer is the most devouring of all others; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>therefore have we known after that such have been by incision
eradicated by our selves and others, and exposed to the view of
the vulgar people, they would presently most earnestly affirm to
others that they had seen it, and that it was a living creature, and
had mouth, eyes and ears; so far will ignorant mistake induce credulity.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. That the force of imagination accompanied with the passions
of horror, fear, envy, malice, earnest, desire of revenge, and the
like, is great upon the body imaginant, as also upon the <em>fœtus</em> in
the womb, is acknowledged by all. But that it can at distance
work upon another body, though denied by <em>Fienus</em> and the whole
rabble of the Schoolmen, yet is strongly proved by this learned Author,
and allowed of by all others that truly understood the operations
of nature, which we also take to be a certain truth, and do assert
that if those people that are esteemed Witches, do really and
truly (of which we utterly doubt) inject any of these strange things
into the bodies of men, that they are brought to pass meerly by
the imagination of the Witch, and the Devil acteth nothing in it
at all, but the setting of his will upon that mischief. As for the
handling the dispute concerning the manner of the injecting of
these strange things, so strongly pursued by this Author, <em>Sennertus</em>
and others, we shall totally supersede and suspend our judgment,
until the <span lang="grc">ὅτι</span> be sufficiently proved (which yet lies under
water, and unseen) and then it will be time enough to dispute the
manner, when the matter is certainly made evident. Therefore
we will shut up this with that modest and grave advice of the Lord
<em>Bacon</em> in these words: <i><span lang="la">Ideo cogemur in hac inquisitione ad nova
experimenta confugere; ubi directiones tantùm eorum præscribi
possunt, non ulla positiva in medium adferri. Si quis putet subsistendum
nobis fuisse, donec tentamentis res penitus innotuisset,

</div>

<p class='c013'><em>That the ignorance of the power of Art and Nature and such
like things, hath much advanced these foolish and impious
opinions.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>The opinions that we reject as foolish and impious are those
we have often named before, to wit, that those that are
vulgarly accounted Witches, make a visible and corporeal contract
with the Devil, that he sucks upon their bodies, that he hath carnal
copulation with them, that they are transubstantiated into
Cats, Dogs, Squirrels, and the like, or that they raise tempests,
and fly in the air. Other powers we grant unto them, to operate
and effect whatsoever the force of natural imagination joyned with
envy, malice and vehement desire of revenge, can perform or perpetrate,
or whatsoever hurt may be done by secret poysons and
such like wayes that work by meer natural means.</p>

<p class='c008'>And here we are to shew the chief causes that do and have advanced
these opinions, and this principally we ascribe to mens ignorance
of the power of Nature and Art, as we shall manifest in
these following particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. There is nothing more certain than, that how great soever
the knowledge of Men be taken to be, yet the ultimate Sphere of
natures activity or ability is not perfectly known, which is made
most manifest in this, that every day there are made new discoveries
of her secrets, which prove plainly that her store is not yet totally
exhausted, nor her utmost efficiency known. And therefore
those Men must needs be precipicious, and build upon a sandy foundation,
that will ascribe corporeal effects unto Devils, and yet know
not the extent of nature, for no Man can rationally assign a beginning
for supernatural agents and actions, that does not certainly
know where the power and operation of nature ends.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. And as it is thus in general, so in many particulars, as especially
in being ignorant of many natural agents that do work at a
great distance, and very occultly, both to help, and to hurt, as in
the weapon salve, the Sympathetick powder, the curing of diseases
by mumial applications, by Amulets, Appensions and Transplantions,
which all have been, and commonly are ascribed unto
Satan, when they are truly wrought by natural operations. And
so (as we have sufficiently manifested before) by many strange,
and secret poysons both natural and artificial, that have no bewitching
power in them at all, but work naturally, and only may
be hurtful in their use through the devilishness of some persons
that use them to diverse evil ends.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. There is nothing that doth more clearly manifest our scanted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>knowledge in the secret operations of nature, and the effects that
she produceth, than the late discoveries of the workings of nature,
both in the vegetable, animal and mineral Kingdoms, brought
dayly to light by the pains and labours of industrious persons: As
is most evident in those many elucubrations, and continued discoveries
of those learned and indefatigable persons that are of the
Royal Society, which do plainly evince that hitherto we have
been ignorant of almost all the true causes of things, and therefore
through blindness have usually attributed those things to the operation
of Cacodemons that were truely wrought by nature, and
thereby not smally augmented and advanced this gross and absurd
opinion of the power of Witches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De occult. Philos.</span></i> <em>l.</em> 1. <em>c.</em> 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. Another great means in advancing these Tenents hath been
Mens supine negligence in not searching into and experimenting
the power of natural agents, but resting satisfied in the sleepy
notions of general rules, and speculative Philosophy. By which
means a prejudice hath been raised against the most occult operations
of nature, and natural magick (which is (as <em>Agrippa</em> truly said)
“The comprizer of great power, full of most high mysteries, and
containeth the most profound contemplation, nature, power,
quality, substance and virtue of most secret things, and the knowledge
of all nature) to be condemned, as the work of the Devil
and hellish fiends, which is the handmaid and instrument of the
Almighty.” And from this diabolical pit of the ignorance of the power
of nature (especially when assisted by art) have sprung up those
black and horrid lies in the mouths of <em>Erastus</em>, <em>Conringius</em> and above
all of <em>Kircherus</em>, denying the possibility of the transmutation
of metals, by the power of Art and Nature, and ascribing the performance
thereof by <em>Paracelsus</em>, <em>Lullius</em>, <em>Sendinogius</em> and others to
the Devil; so malevolent do men grow when they are led by nescience
and ignorance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Theatr. Chym.</em> <em>Vol.</em> 5. <em>p.</em> 943.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. The ignorance of the strange and wonderful things that Art
can bring to pass hath been no less a cause, why the most admirable
things that Art bringeth to pass by it are through blind ignorance
ascribed unto Devils, for so have many brave learned Artists,
and Mechanicians been accused for Conjurers, as happened to <em>Roger
Bacon</em>, Dr. <em>Dee</em>, <em>Trithemius</em>, <em>Cornelius Agrippa</em>, and many others,
when what they performed was by lawful and laudable art.
The strange things that the Mathematicks and Mechanicks can
perform are hardly to be enumerated, of which were those most
wonderful catoptrical glasses mentioned by <em>Nicero</em>, <em>Aquilonius</em>,
<em>Baptista Porta</em> and many others, those wonderful engines in the
shape of Birds, Men, Beasts, and Fishes that do move, sing, hiss and
many such like things mentioned by <em>Heron</em> of <em>Alexandria</em>, and our
Countryman Dr. <em>Fludd</em>; and those that would have more ample
satisfaction concerning the stupendious things that are produced by
art, may receive most large satisfaction in reading that most learned
and elaborate Epistle written as a preface before the Book of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span><em>Johannes Ernestus Burgravius</em> called <i><span lang="la">Biolychnium vel de lampade
vitæ et mortis</span></i>, by <em>Marcellus Vranckheim</em> Doctor of both laws, as
also in reading that profound and mysterious piece written by <em>Roger
Bacon</em>, <i><span lang="la">de admirabili potestate artis et naturæ, et de nullitate
magiæ</span></i>, with the learned notes of Dr. <em>Dee</em> upon it, of which he
saith this: <i><span lang="la">Ut videatur quod omnis potestas magica sit inferior his
operibus et indigna</span></i>. And therefore there can be nothing more
unworthy, than for any man, that pretendeth to any portion of
reason, so far to dote, or suffer himself to be led with ignorance
and rashness, as to ascribe those strange things that Nature and Art,
or both joined together do produce, unto Devils: And yet there
is nothing that is more common not only by the blind vulgar,
but even by those that otherwise would be accounted learned, and
wise enough; pride and folly attendeth the most of the Sons of
Men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>6. Another gross mistake there is, in supposing those strange
things that are performed by vaulters, tumblers, dancers upon
ropes, and such like, not possible to be done but by the assistance
of the Devil, when they are altogether brought to pass and effected
by use, custome, exercise, nimbleness and agility of body. And
yet we have known some not only of the popular rank, but many
that thought themselves both wise, learned and religious that
have been so blind as to father these things upon Devils and seriously
to seem to believe, that the actors of these things had made
a league and compact with the Devil, by whose help they performed
them. And I do remember that a pretty active young man,
within these few years went about in this North Countrey with a
neat Bay Mare for money to shew tricks, which were very odd
and strange, for if she had been blindfolded, and several pieces of
money taken from several persons, and wrapped in a cloath, the
Mare would have given every one their own piece of money; and
this and many other feats she plaid, were not only by the common
people, but by others that should have been more wise, judged to
be performed by no other means but by the Devil, and some were
so stark mad as to believe and affirm that the Mare was not a natural
one, but that it was the Devil that plaid those strange tricks
in the shape of a Mare: when more sober judgments knew that they
were performed by the masters eye, and rod directing the Mare.
<i><span lang="la">Error &#38; credulitas multum in hominibus possunt.</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>7. In like manner are often both those that are learned, as well
as the vulgar most wofully imposed upon by the odd and strange
feats performed by Legierdemain, sleight of hand, and by wonderful
things brought to pass by subtile and cunning Impostors that
act by confederacy, and the like, of which we have given some
instances before in this treatise. And it was no evil piece of service,
that Master <em>Scot</em> did in his book of the discovery of Witchcraft,
when he laid open all the several tricks of Legierdemain and sleight
of hand, thereby to undeceive the ignorant multitude; and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>is no less praise-worthy that is performed by the Author of that
little treatise called <em>Hocus Pocus junior</em>, where all the feats are set
forth in their proper colours, so that the most ignorant may see
how they are done, and that they are miracles unknown, and but
bables being discovered, which treatise I could commend to be
read of all Witchmongers and vain credulous persons, that thereby
their ignorance may be laid open, and they convinced of their errors.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. The ignorance or mistaking of these things, joyned with the
notions Men have imbibed from their infancy, together with irreligious
education, are the true and proper causes, that make so
many ascribe that power to Devils and Witches, that they neither
have, or ever had, or can ever bring into act. And therefore it
behoveth all that would judge aright of these abstruse matters, to
labour to understand the secret operations of nature, and the
strange works of art, to divest themselves of their false imbibed notions,
and truely and rightly to understand the Articles of the Christian
Faith, to be daily conversant in reading the Scriptures, they
will then be more fit to judge of these things, and not to call light
darkness, nor darkness light.</p>

couzenings and impostures, yet therefore it will not follow that all
are so. To which we shall render these answers.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. If it do not necessarily conclude, that they are all impostures,
yet it gives a most shrewd cause of dubitation that they may be so.
And the objection depends not upon a necessary connexion betwixt
the subject and predicate, for some being direct and palpable Impostures,
it is not of necessity, but by contingency or accident that
the others are not so, and ought first to have been proved, which
never yet was performed.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. But we affirm that a general conclusion drawn from an inductive
argument is good and sound, where no instance can be clearly
made out to the contrary. But as yet no true instance, really
and faithfully attested, hath ever been brought to prove that any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>of these things that we deny, were ever effected by diabolical power.
For who were ever by and present, that were persons of sincerity
and sound judgment, that could truly testifie and averr that
the Devil in a visible and corporeal shape made a contract with
the Witch, or that he suckt upon his, or her body, or that he had
carnal copulation with them, or that saw when the Witch was really
changed into a Dog or a Cat, or that they flew or were carried in
the air? Seeing no instance can be given to prove any of these to be
undoubted truths, it must needs follow that they are meer figments,
or at the best all but absolute Impostures. And again it is but
precarious, and <i><span lang="la">petitio principii</span></i>, to imagine that any persons have
vomited up or voided strange things that saw or knew that they
were injected by Devils, for they were either naturally bred there,
or else were meer Impostures and delusive Juglings.</p>

<p class='c008'>And therefore we shall propose some Histories of strange and
prodigious cheats and Impostures from late and unquestionable authorities,
whereby all the rest may be judged and discerned; of which
take this for one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“1. <em>Elizabeth Barton</em> of <em>Kent</em> (by those that laboured to cry
up her horrible cheats for miracles, otherwise called the holy
Maid of <em>Kent</em>) and others were in the twenty fifth year of King
<em>Henry</em> the Eighth attainted of High Treason, for that under colour
of hypocrisie, Revelations and false Miracles practised by
the said <em>Elizabeth</em>, they conspired to impugne and slander the
divorce between the King and Queen <em>Katherine</em> his first Wife,
and the last Marriage between him and Queen <em>Anne</em> his second
Wife, to destroy the King, and to deprive him of his Crown.”
Her false and feigned miracles, and the subtile and cunning contrivances
that were brought to pass by the help of her confederate
accomplices, and her and the others open confession of them
may be found at large in <em>Hollingshead</em>, <em>Stow</em>, and the writings of
Mr. <em>Lambert</em>, whither for brevities sake I remit my reader, and
shall only give it here in the words of <em>Speed</em>, which are these:
“The Romanists (he saith) much fearing that <em>Babel</em> would down,
if Queen <em>Anne</em> might be heard against wicked <em>Haman</em>, sought to
underprop the foundations thereof with certain devices of their
own: and that the same might pass without note of suspicion,
they laid their forgery even upon Heaven it self; whose pretended
oracle <em>Elizabeth Barton</em> (commonly called the holy Maid
of <em>Kent</em>) was made to be; and the pillars of this godless Fabrick
were <em>Edward Bocking</em> a Monk by profession, and Doctor of Divinity,
<em>Richard Masters</em> Parson of <em>Aldington</em>, the Town wherein
she dwelt; <em>Richard Deering</em> a Monk, <em>Hugh Rich</em> a Friar, <em>John
Adestone</em> and <em>Thomas Abell</em> Priests, put to their helping hands;
and <em>Henry Gould</em> Batchelor of Divinity, with <em>John Fisher</em> the reverend
Father of <em>Rochester</em> imployed their pains to dawb these
downfalling walls with their untempered morter. The Scribes
that set their pens for her miracles, were <em>Edward Thwaites</em> Gentleman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and <em>Thomas Lawrence</em> Register, besides <em>Haukherst</em> a Monk,
who writ a letter that was forged to be sent her from Heaven;
And <em>Richard Risby</em> and <em>Thomas Gould</em> were the men that dispersed
her miracles abroad to the world. This holy Maid <em>Elizabeth</em>
made a Votaress in <em>Canterbury</em>, was taught by <em>Bocking</em> her
Ghostly Father, and suspected Paramour, to counterfeit many
feigned trances, and in the same to utter many virtuous words
for the rebuke of sin, under which more freely she was heard against
<em>Luthers</em> doctrine, and the Scriptures translation, then desired
of many: neither so only, but that she gave forth from
God and his Saints by sundry suggestive Revelations, that if the
King proceeded in his Divorce, and second Marriage, he should
not raign in his Realm one month after, nor rest in Gods favour
the space of an hour. But the truth discovered by Gods true
Ministers, this oracle gave place as all other such did, when Christ
by his death stopped their lying mouths: For her self and seven
of her disciples were executed for Treason at <em>Tiburn</em>, and the other
six put to their fines and imprisonment.” To which he subjoineth
this story of the like nature. “With the like counterfeit
Revelations and feigned predictions this generation of hypocrites
had brought <em>Edward</em> Lord <em>Stafford</em> Duke of <em>Buckingham</em>, unto
his unhappy end, by the working of <em>John de la Court</em>
his own Confessor, together with <em>Nicholas Hopkins</em> a Monk of
the Carthusian Order in the Priory of <em>Henton</em> in <em>Somersetshire</em>,
who by his visions from Heaven forsooth, heartned him for the
Crown; But before his own Coronet could aspire to that top,
he worthily lost both head and all upon <em>Tower-hill</em> for his Treason,
<i><span lang="it">Anno Domini</span></i> 1521. Unto such sins the world was then
subject, and into such conceits their reputed holiness had brought
them, not only among the simple and unlettered, but even with
them that seemed to be learned indeed: For by certain predictions
foreshewing a great deluge, Prior <em>Bolton</em> of S. <em>Bartholomews</em>
in <em>London</em>, was so fearful that he built himself a house upon
the height of <em>Harrowhill</em>, storing it with provisions necessary
to keep himself from drowning in <i><span lang="it">Anno Dom.</span></i> 1524.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stow’s <em>Chron.</em> <em>p.</em> 678.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. And that we may be certified how frequent and common these
counterfeited Impostures have been, and yet are practised, take
this other from undoubted authority. “The 15 of <em>August</em> being
Sunday in the 16 of the raign of Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>, <em>Agnes Bridges</em>
a Maid about the age of 20 years, and <em>Rachel Pinder</em> a Wench about
the age of 11 or 12 years, who both of them had counterfeited
to be possessed by the Devil (whereby they had not only
marvellously deluded many people both Men and Women, but also
diverse such persons, as otherwise seemed of good wit and
understanding) stood before the Preacher at <em>Pauls-cross</em>; where
they acknowledged their hypocritical counterfeiting with penitent
behaviours, requiring forgiveness of God and the world, and
the people to pray for them. Also their several examinations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and Confessions were there openly read by the Preacher, and afterwards
published in print, for posterity hereafter to beware of
the like deceivers.” From whence we may take these two Observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. We may from hence note, how subject the nature of man is
both to deceive and to be deceived, and that not only the common
people, but also the wiser and more learned heads may most easily
be imposed upon. And, that therefore in things of this nature, and
the like, we cannot use too much circumspection, nor use too much
diligence to discover them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. We may note, that when such strange Impostures or false Miracles
are pretended, there is commonly some sinister and corrupt end
aimed at, under the colour of Religion, and that those that are
most ready to publish such things as true Miracles and Divine Revelations,
are generally those that did complot and devise them. And
therefore the greater number they be that cry them up, and the more
esteem the persons are of that blow abroad such things, the greater
suspicion we ought to have of the falsity and forgery of them. Always
remembring that the greater the fame and number of the persons
are that conspire and confederate together, the greater things they
may bring to pass, and be more able to deceive, as was manifest by the
Priests attending the Oracles; who, though they laboured to father
their predictions upon some Deity, yet it was manifest that it was nothing
else, but their own Confederacy, Impostures and Juglings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. ibid. Dialog.</em> 11. <em>p.</em> 352.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. But these Diabolical Counterfeitings of possessions, and the
maintaining of the power of dispossession and casting forth of Devils,
was not only upheld and maintained by the Papists to advance
their superstitious courses; but also in the said time of Queen
<em>Elizabeth</em>, there were divers Non-Conformists, to gain credit and
repute to their way, that did by publick writing labour to prove
the continuation of real possessions by Devils, and that they had
power by fasting and Prayer to cast them out. Of which number
were one M<sup>r</sup> <em>Darrell</em> and his Accomplices, who not only writ divers
Pamphlets in the positive defence of that opinion, but also
published certain Narrations of several persons, that they pretended
were really possessed with Devils, which were cast forth by their
means in using Fasting and Prayer. Which writings were answered
by M<sup>r</sup> <em>Harsnet</em> and others, and their Theory not only overthrown,
but their practice discovered to be counterfeiting and Imposture.
Whereupon there were divers persons suborned to feign and counterfeit
possessions, as <em>William Sommers</em> of <em>Nottingham</em>, who by the Exorcists
was reported to have strange fits, passions and actions; which
are at large described and set forth in that learned Treatise, <em>Dialogical
Discourses of Spirits and Devils</em>, written about the same time
by <em>John Deacon</em> and <em>John Waller</em>, Ministers, and of divers other
persons who likewise pretended the same counterfeit possessions.
And though the said forged and feigned possessions were strongly
maintained by their Abettors, and the matters of fact audaciously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>asserted to be true; yet after the said <em>Darrell</em> and his Accomplices
were examined by the Queens Commissioners, all was made apparent
to be notorious counterfeiting, cheating and imposture, both
by the confession of <em>Sommers</em> himself, and by the Oaths of several
Deponents. Neither was that discourse containing the certain possession
of seven persons in one Family in <em>Lancashire</em>, at <em>Cheworth</em>
in the Parish of <em>Leigh</em>, in the Year 1594. (though believed by many
for a truth, because of the streight tale told by the said <em>Darrell</em>
in that Narrative) of any better grain, but full of untruths,
impossibilities, absurdities and contradictions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid.</em> The cunning of the Boy of <em>Bilson</em>, <em>p.</em> 55.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. Our next instance shall be a most strange imposture acted in
the time of King <em>James</em>, and in a manner known unto the whole
Nation; that is of the Boy of <em>Bilson</em> in <em>Staffordshire</em>, in the year
1620. by name <em>William Perry</em>, whose condition as he had been
taught, and so left by the Popish Priests, take as followeth. “This
Boy being about thirteen years old (but for wit and subtilty far
exceeding his age) was thought by divers to be possessed of the
Devil, and bewitched, by reason of many strange fits and much
distemper, wherewith he seemed to have been extreamly affected.
In those fits he appeared both deaf and blind, writhing his mouth
aside, continually groaning and panting, and (although often
pinched with mens fingers, pricked with Needles, tickled on his
sides, and once whipped with a Rod, besides other the like extremities)
yet could he not be discerned by either shrieking or
shrinking to bewray the least passion or feeling. Out of his fits
he took (as might be thought) no sustenance which he could digest,
but together with it, did void and cast out of his mouth,
rags, thred, straw, crooked pins, <em>&#38;c.</em> Both in and out of his fits
his belly (by wilful and continual abstinence defrauding his own
Guts) was almost as flat as his back, besides, his throat was swoln
and hard, his tongue stiff and rolled up towards the roof of his
mouth, insomuch that he seemed always dumb, save that he would
speak once in a Fortnight or three Weeks, and that but in very few
words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two things there were which gave most just cause of presumption
that he was possessed and bewitched; one was that he could
still discern when that Woman (which was supposed to have bewitched
him) to wit <em>Jone Cocke</em> was brought in to any room
where he was, although she were secretly conveyed thither, as
was one time tryed before the Grand Jury at <em>Stafford</em>: The second,
that though he would abide other passages of Scripture,
yet he could not indure the repeating of that Text, <em>viz.</em> <i><span lang="la">In the
beginning was the word, &#38;c.</span></i> <em>Jo.</em> 1. <em>ver.</em> 1. but instantly rolling
his eyes and shaking his head, as one distracted, he would fall
into his usual fits of groaning, panting, distraction, <em>&#38;c.</em> In which
plight he continued many months, to the great wonder and astonishment
of thousands, who from divers parts came to see him.”
Thus much of his cunning.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Yet notwithstanding, this most devillish and cunningly contrived
counterfeiting and dissimulation was discovered and fully detected
by the sagacity of that pious and learned person, D<sup>r</sup> <em>Thomas Morton</em>
then Bishop of <em>Coventry</em> and <em>Lichfield</em>: To whose memory I
cannot but owe and make manifest all due respect, because he was
well known unto me, and by the imposition of whose hands I was
ordained Presbyter when he was Bishop of <em>Durham</em>, and also knew
his then Secretary, M<sup>r</sup> <em>Richard Baddeley</em>, who was the Notary, and
writ the examination of this crafty Boy. The manner how such a
doubtful and intricate piece of Imposture was found out and discovered,
you may read at large in the Treatise called <em>a Discourse
concerning Popish Exorcising</em>. And his publick Confession we shall
give in the Authors own words: “He was finally brought again
to the Summer Assizes held at <em>Stafford</em>, the 26. of <em>July</em>, <i><span lang="it">Anno</span></i>
1621. where before Sir <em>Peter Warburton</em> and Sir <em>Humfrey Winch</em>
Knights, his Majesties Justices of Assize, and the face of the County
and Country there assembled, the Boy craved pardon first of
Almighty God, then desired the Woman there also present to forgive
him; and lastly, requested the whole Country whom he had
so notoriously and wickedly scandalized, to admit of that his so
hearty Confession for their satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And thus it pleased God (he saith) to open the eyes of this
Boy (that I may so say) <em>luto</em> with the Clay of the Romish Priests
lewd Impostures, and <em>sputo</em> with the spittle of his own infamy, to
see his errors and to glorifie the God of truth. And though many
such Impostures as this have in several ages been hudled up in
darkness and recorded for true stories, by those that were Partisans
to them and Confederates with them, yet doubtless were but of
the same stamp with this, and might all as well have been discovered,
if the like care, skill and industry had been used.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 5.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid.</em> The arraignment and tryal of Witches at <em>Lancaster</em>, 1612.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. No less villanous, bloody and Diabolical, was the design of
<em>Thompson alias Southworth</em>, Priest or Jesuit, against <em>Jennet Bierley</em>,
<em>Jane Southworth</em>, and <em>Ellen Bierly</em> of <em>Samesbury</em> in the County of
<em>Lancaster</em>, in the year 1612. the sum of which is this. “The said
<em>Jennet Bierley</em>, <em>Ellen Bierley</em>, and <em>Jane Southworth</em>, were Indicted
at the Assizes holden at <em>Lancaster</em> upon <em>Wednesday</em> the nineteenth
of <em>August</em>, in the year abovesaid, for that they and every of them
had practised, exercised, and used divers devillish and wicked
Arts, called Witchcrafts, Inchantments, Charms and Sorceries, in
and upon one <em>Grace Sowerbutts</em>. And the chief witness to prove
this was <em>Grace Sowerbutts</em> her self, who said that they did draw
her by the hair of the head, and take her sense and memory from
her, did throw her upon the Hen-roost and Hay-mow; did appear
to her sometimes in their own likeness, sometimes like a black
Dog with two feet, that they carried her where they met black
things like men that danced with them, and did abuse their bodies;
and that they brought her to one <em>Thomas Walsham</em>’s House in the
night, and there they killed his Child by putting a nail into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Navil, and after took it forth of the Grave, and did boil it, and
eat some of it, and made Oyl of the bones, and such like horrid
lies.” But there appearing sufficient grounds of suspicion that it
was practised knavery, the said <em>Grace Sowerbutts</em> was by the wisdom,
and care of Sir <em>Edward Bromley</em> Knight, one of his Majesties
Justices of Assize at <em>Lancaster</em>, appointed to be examined by <em>William
Leigh</em> and <em>Edward Chisnal</em> Esquires, two of his Majesties Justices
of peace in the same County, and so thereupon made this free
confession. Being demanded “whether the accusation she laid upon
her Grandmother, <em>Jennet Bierley</em>, <em>Ellen Bierley</em> and <em>Jane Southworth</em>,
of Witchcraft, <em>viz.</em> of the killing of the child of <em>Thomas
Walshman</em>, with a nail in the Navil, the boyling, eating and oyling,
thereby to transform themselves into divers shapes, was true?
She doth utterly deny the same, or that ever she saw any such
practises done by them. She further saith, that one Mr. <em>Thompson</em>,
which she taketh to be Mr. <em>Christopher Southworth</em>, to whom
she was sent to say her prayers, did perswade, counsel and advise
her, to deal as formerly hath been said against her said Grandmother,
Aunt and <em>Southworths</em> Wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And further she confesseth, and saith, that she never did know,
or saw any Devils, nor any other visions, as formerly hath been
alledged and informed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Also she confesseth, and saith, that she was not thrown, or
cast upon the Hen-roust, and Hay-mow in the Barn, but that she
went up upon the Mow by the wall side. Being further demanded
whether she ever was at the Church, she saith, she was not, but
promised hereafter to go to Church, and that very willingly; of
which the author of the relation gives this judgment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How well (he saith) this project, to take away the lives of
three innocent poor creatures by practice and villany, to induce
a young Scholar to commit perjury, to accuse her own Grandmother,
Aunt, <em>&#38;c.</em> agrees either with the title of a Jesuit, or
the duty of a religious Priest who should rather profess sincerity
and innocency, than practise treachery! But this was lawful, for
they are Hereticks accursed, to leave the company of Priests, to
frequent Churches, hear the word of God preached, and profess
religion sincerely.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 6.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>6. But we shall shut up the relating of these prodigious and
hellish stories, of these kind of couzening and cheating delusions
and impostures, with one instance more that is no less notorious
than these that we have rehearsed. About the year 1634 (for
having lost our notes of the same, we cannot be so exact as we
should) there was a great pretended meeting of many supposed
Witches at a new house or barn, in <em>Pendle</em> Forest in <em>Lancashire</em>,
then not inhabited, where (as the accusation pretended) some of
them by pulling by a rope of Straw or Hay, did bring Milk, Butter,
Cheese, and the like, and were carried away upon Dogs,
Cats or Squirrels. The informer was one <em>Edmund Robinson</em> (yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>living at the writing hereof, and commonly known by the name
of <em>Ned</em> of <em>Roughs</em>) whose Father was by trade a Waller, and but
a poor Man, and they finding that they were believed and had incouragement
by the adjoyning Magistrates, and the persons being
committed to prison or bound over to the next Assizes, the boy,
his Father and some others besides did make a practice to go from
Church to Church that the Boy might reveal and discover Witches,
pretending that there was a great number at the pretended
meeting, whose faces he could know; and by that means they got
a good living, that in a short space the Father bought a Cow or
two, when he had none before. And it came to pass that this said
Boy was brought into the Church of <em>Kildwick</em> a large parish Church,
where I (being then Curate there) was preaching in the afternoon,
and was set upon a stall (he being but about ten or eleven years
old) to look about him, which moved some little disturbance in
the Congregation for a while. And after prayers I inquiring what
the matter was, the people told me that it was the Boy that discovered
Witches, upon which I went to the house where he was to
stay all night, where I found him, and two very unlikely persons
that did conduct him, and manage the business; I desired to have
some discourse with the Boy in private, but that they utterly refused;
then in the presence of a great many people, I took the Boy
near me, and said: Good Boy tell me truly, and in earnest, did
thou see and hear such strange things of the meeting of Witches;
as is reported by many that thou dost relate, or did not some person
teach thee to say such things of thy self? But the two men not
giving the Boy leave to answer, did pluck him from me, and said
he had been examined by two able Justices of the Peace, and they
did never ask him such a question, to whom I replied, the persons
accused had therefore the more wrong. But the Assizes following
at <em>Lancaster</em> there were seventeen found guilty by the Jury, yet
by the prudent discretion of the Judge, who was not satisfied with
the evidence, they were reprieved, and his Majesty and his
Council being informed by the Judge of the matter, the Bishop of
<em>Chester</em> was appointed to examine them, and to certifie what he
thought of them, which he did; and thereupon four of them; to
wit <em>Margaret Johnson</em>, <em>Francis Dicconson</em>, <em>Mary Spenser</em>, and <em>Hargrieves</em>
Wife, were sent for up to <em>London</em>, and were viewed and examined
by his Majesties Physicians and Chirurgeons, and after by
his Majesty and the Council, and no cause of guilt appearing but
great presumptions of the boys being suborned to accuse them
falsely. Therefore it was resolved to separate the Boy from his Father,
they having both followed the women up to <em>London</em>, they
were both taken and put into several prisons asunder. Whereupon
shortly after the Boy confessed that he was taught and suborned to
devise, and feign those things against them, and had persevered in that
wickedness by the counsel of his Father, and some others, whom
envy, revenge and hope of gain had prompted on to that devillish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>design and villany; and he also confessed, that upon that day when
he said that they met at the aforesaid house or barn, he was
that very day a mile off, getting Plums in his Neighbours Orchard.
And that this is a most certain truth, there are many persons yet
living, of sufficient reputation and integrity, that can avouch and
testifie the same; and besides, what I write is the most of it true, upon
my own knowledge, and the whole I have had from his own
mouth more than once.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus having brought these unquestionable Histories to manifest
the horrid cheats and impostures that are practised for base, wicked
and devillish ends, we must conclude in opposing that objection
proposed in the beginning of this Chapter, which is this: That
though some be discovered to be counterfeitings and impostures,
yet all are not so, to which we further answer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. That all those things that are now adayes supposed to be
done by Demoniacks or those that pretend possessions, as also all those
strange feats pretended to be brought to pass by Witches or Witchcraft,
are all either performed by meer natural causes (for it is
granted upon all sides that Devils in corporeal matter can perform
nothing but by applying fit actives to agreeable passives.) And
miracles being long since ceased, it must needs follow, that Devils
do nothing but only draw the minds of Men and Women unto sin
and wickedness, and thereby they become deceivers, cheats and
notorious impostours: so that we may rationally conclude that all
other strange feats and delusions, must of necessity be no better,
or of any other kind, than these we have recited, except they can
shew that they are brought to pass by natural means. Must not all
persons that are of sound understanding judge and believe that all
those strange tricks related by Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> of his Drummer
at Mr. <em>Mompessons</em> house, whom he calls the Demon of <em>Tedworth</em>,
were abominable cheats and impostures (as I am informed from persons
of good quality they were discovered to be) for I am sure
Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> can shew no agents in nature, that the Demon applying
them to fit patients, could produce any such effects by, and therefore
we must conclude all such to be impostures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. It is no sound way of reasoning, from the principles of
knowing, either thereby to prove the existence of things, or
the modes of such existence, because the principle of being is the
cause of the principle of knowing, and not on the contrary, and
therefore our not discovering of all Impostures that are or have
been acted, doth not at all conclude the rest that pass undiscovered,
are diabolical or wrought by a supernatural power; for it ought
first to be demonstrated that there are now in these days some
things wrought by the power of Devils, that are supernatural, in
elementary and corporeal matter, which never was nor can be, as
from the testimonies of all the learned we have shewed before.
And therefore a man might as well argue that there are no more
thieves in a Nation, but those that are known, and brought to condign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>punishment, when there may be, and doubtless are many more;
so likewise there are many hundreds of impostures, that pass and
are never discovered, but that will not at all rationally conclude
that those must be diabolical that are not made known.</p>

not one subject (that we know of) in the World that is liable to
so many mistakes, by reason of the prepossessed fancies of men, in
adhering to those fictions of Spirits, Fairies, Hobgoblins, and many
such like, which are continually heightned by ignorant education,
and vain melancholy fears. We shall not mention those many apparitions
that are frequently practised by forgery and confederacy,
for base ends and interests, as have been commonly used in the
time of Popery, and attempted in our dayes, though with little
success. As also by other persons for base lucre or worse intents,
of which we have known some notorious ones that have been discovered.
Neither shall we speak of those feigned ones that have been
practised to hide thievery and roguery, as we once knew that certain
persons who stole mens sheep in the night, did carry them away
upon a thing made like a Bier covered with a white sheet, by
which means those that saw them took it to be an apparition, and
so durst not come near them, and so the most part of the people of
3 or 4 Villages were terrified, and the report was far spred that it
was a walking spirit, and yet at last discovered to be a cunning
piece of knavery to hide their theft withal. Neither shall we say any
thing of those ludicrous apparitions that are often practised to terrifie,
abuse, and affright others. But we shall here give the relation
of some strange creatures, that seldom being seen or found,
have induced more ignorant persons to take them for Demons, and
these we shall enumerate in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It hath been, and still is a strong opinion amongst the vulgars
and Witchmongers also, that Witches transforming themselves
into diverse shapes, did in the night time enter into peoples
houses, and then and there suck the breasts or navils of infants in
their Beds or Cradles, that thereby they were weakned or consumed
away; which inveterate opinion was the more firmly believed,
because children that at night were very well, in the morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>were found to be very ill, and to have been sucked in the places
aforesaid. To clear which point take this Observation from the learned
pen of <em>Thomas Bartholinus</em> that was Physician to <em>Frederick</em> King
of <em>Denmark</em>, in English thus. “Three infants (he saith) of the
<em>Pastor Fionens</em> at <em>Lyckisholm</em>, which is a noble Mannor belonging
to the very illustrious Lord <em>Christian Thomæus Sehsted</em>, the Kings
Chancellor, <i><span lang="la">Eques Auratus</span></i>, and a most renowned Senator of
<em>Denmark</em>, my <em>Mecænas</em>, that were sleeping in their accustomed
Chamber, were not long after troubled with an unwonted bewailing
and inquietude, that they felt themselves to be sucked or
milked of something. The nipples of their breasts being diligently
handled by the Parents did confirm the Childrens suspicion, because
they did hang out like a Womans that did give suck. And
to prevent this fascination, the nipples of the breasts were anointed
with preservatives against poyson and other bitter things. Hereupon
their Navils were so worn with vehement suction, that not
only they were prominent or did hang out, but also did as it were
shew the greatness of the mouth that had sucked by the impression
remaining. But the Infants being carried forth of the Chamber,
did from thenceforth rest free from any suction, especially being
carried in peoples arms. And this <em>Caprimulgus</em> or Goat-milker, is
by <em>Bellonius</em> said to be in <em>Crete</em> of the bigness of a Cuckow, being
very hurtful to the Goats, insomuch that it sucketh milk from
their dugs on the nights.” By which we may plainly understand,
how Creatures that are but seldom seen, or whose properties are
unknown, may easily effect those things that ignorant heads may
impute unto Witchcraft.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. It is no less believed by many, that those kind of Creatures
which are called Satyres are but a kind of Demons; for learned
Gesner reckoning them to be a kind of Apes, doth tell us this:
“Even as (he saith) the Apes <em>Cynocephali</em>, or with Dogs-heads,
have given the occasion of the Fable, that some have thought such
to be men: So Satyrs being also a rare kind of Apes, and of
greater admiration, some have believed them to be Devils: also
of some men deluded by the Poets and Painters, as also Statuaries,
who have feigned that they had Goats feet and horns, the
more to augment the admiration and superstition, they have been
thought Devils: when in Ape-Satyres there is no such thing to be
seen.” And this opinion hath been the more strengthened because
the most of the Translators have in the Old Testament rendered the
word <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>שָׂעִיר</span> (which properly signifieth an happy man or beast) a
Goat, a Satyre, (as <em>Gen.</em> 27. <em>ver.</em> 11. <em>Esau my Brother is a hairy man</em>;
where the very same word is used) Demon, or Devil. But it is plain
that it did and doth signifie no more but only Satyrs, as will appear
by these reasons. 1. First, as our English Translators have truly rendred
it in that of <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i>, <em>And the Satyre shall cry unto his fellow</em>:
for it is certainly related, both by ancient and modern Navigators,
that in those desolate Islands where there are store of them, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>will upon the nights make great shouting and crying, and calling
one unto another. And in another place of the same Prophet it is
said by the same Translators, <em>and Satyres shall dance there</em>; dancing
being one of the properties of that hairy Creature, as a thing it is
much delighted with, and so are but Satyres that are natural Creatures
and not Devils. 2. And though the same Translators have rendred
the plural of the same word, by the name Devils, yet it there
properly signifieth also Satyres; for though in another place it be
said; <em>they sacrificed to devils, not to God</em>, and so again by the
Psalmist, for <em>they sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils</em>;
where in both places the word is <span lang='he' dir='rtl'>שֵדִים</span> <i><span lang="la">vastatoribus</span></i>, to the destroyers
or to Devils; because in those Idols the Devils were worshipped,
and thereby destroyed the souls of men: 3. Yet it is manifest that
their Idols were formed in the shape of Satyres, in a most terrible
manner; for the late and most credible travellers that have been in
those parts of <em>Asia</em>, where those Idolatries are still upholden, do
unanimously relate that they make their Images or Idols that they
worship, as terrible and frightful as they can devise, as may be seen
in the relations of the Travels of <em>Vincent le Blanc</em>, <em>Mandelslo</em>, and
<em>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto</em>, and M<sup>r</sup> <em>Herbert</em> our Countryman gives
us the Idol of the Bannyans in the ugly shape of a monstrous Satyre.
4. So that though this worshipping and sacrificing, in respect
of its abominableness, filthiness and Idolatrousness, was yielded to
Devils, which spiritually and invisibly ruled in these Children of
disobedience, and was the Author of all those delusions and impostures;
yet it doth no where appear, that it was Demons in the
corporeal shape of Satyres (as many have erroneously supposed) no
more than the golden Calves that <em>Jeroboam</em> made, were real Devils:
but these Idols were made in the figure or shape of Satyrs or hairy
Creatures, as saith the Text: <em>And he ordained him Priests for the
high places</em>, and for the hairy Idols or Satyres, <em>and for the Calves
that he had made</em>. It is the same Hebrew word here that our English
Translators render Devils, that in the two former places of <i><span lang="la">Isaiah</span></i>
they translate Satyres; and as the Calves are not rendred Devils,
why should the Images that were like Satyres be translated so? Surely
the Devil was as much in the Calves, and as much worshipped in
those dumb Idols as he was in the dumb and dead Idols or Images
of the Satyres, and so no more reason to call the one Devils than the
other. But that which totally overthrows the conceit that they
should be real Devils in corporeal shapes and figures, is this, that
both the Calves and the Images of these Satyres were made by
<em>Jeroboam</em>: now it is manifest that he could not make a real Devil,
but only Images of Calves and Satyres, wherein and whereby the
Devils might be worshipped in those Idolatrous ways.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. Medic.</em> <em>lib.</em> 3. <em>c.</em> 56. <em>p.</em> 283.</div>

<p class='c008'>So that it is most apparent, that these Satyres being seldom seen and
of strange qualities, have made many to believe that they were Demons;
nay it seems their Images and Pictures have been taken for
Devils, and yet are but meer natural Creatures, and by learned men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>accounted a kind of Apes, which we shall now prove by an undeniable
instance or two; and first this from the pen of that learned
Physician <em>Nicholaus Tulpius</em>, who saith thus: “In our remembrance
(he saith) there was an Indian Satyre brought from <em>Angola</em>; and
presented as a gift to <em>Frederick Henry</em> Prince of <em>Aurange</em>. This
Satyre was four-footed and from the humane shape which it seems
to bear, it is called of the Indians <em>Orang antang</em>, <i><span lang="la">homo silvestris</span></i>,
a wild man, and of the Africans <em>Quoias morron</em>, expressing in longitude
a Child of three years old, and in crassitude, one of six
years. It was of body neither fat nor lean, but square, most able
and very swift. And of its joints so firm, and the Muscles so large,
that it durst undertake and could do any thing; on the foreparts
altogether smooth, and rough behind, and covered with black
hairs. Its face did resemble a man, but the nose broad and crooked
downwards, rugged and a toothless female. But the ears were
not different from humane shape. As neither the breast, adorned
on both sides with a swelling dug (for it was of the feminine Sex)
the belly had a very deep navil; and the joints, both those above
and those below, had such an exact similitude with man, that one
egg doth not seem more like another. Neither was there awanting
a requisite commissure to the arm, nor the order of fingers to
the hands, nor an humane shape to the thumb, or a prop of the
legs to the thighs, or of the heel to the foot. Which fit and decent
form of the members, was the cause that for most part it did go
upright: neither did it lift up any kind of weight less heavily than
remove it easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it was about to drink it would hold the handle of the
Kan with the one hand, and put the other under the bottom of the
Cup, then would it wipe off the moysture left upon its lips, not
less neatly than thou shouldest see the most delicate Courtier.
Which same dexterity it did observe when it went to bed. For
lying her head upon the Pillow, and fitly covering her body with
the Cloaths, it did hide it self no otherwise, than if the most delicate
person had laid there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>Moreover the King of <em>Samback</em> (he saith) did one time tell
our Kinsman <em>Samuel Blomart</em>, that these kind of Satyres, especially
the Males in the Iland of <em>Borneo</em>, have so great boldness of
mind and such a strong compaction of Muscles, that they have often
forceably set upon armed men; and not only upon the weak sex of
Women and Girls; with the flagrant desire of which they are so
inflamed, that catching them often they abuse them. For they are
highly prone to lust (which is common to these, with the lustful
Satyres of the ancients) yea sometimes so keen and salacious, that
therefore the Indian Women do eschew the Woods and Groves as
worse than a Dog or a Snake; in which these impudent animals
do lie hid. And that this lascivious animal is found in the Eastern
Mountains of <em>India</em>; as also in <em>Africa</em>, between <em>Sierra</em>, <em>Liona</em>,
and the Promontory of the Mountain, where (perhaps) were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>those places where <em>Plinius</em> <em>lib.</em> 5. <em>cap.</em> 5. affirmeth that upon the
nights there was seen to shine frequent Fires of the Ægipanes, and
to abound with the lasciviousness of the Satyres, who do love
craggy Dens and Caves, and shun the society of mankind, being
a salacious, hairy, four-footed Creature, with human shape and a
crooked nose. But that the foot of this Creature neither hath hoofs
nor the body every where hairs, but only the head, shoulders and
back. The rest of the parts are smooth, and the Ears are not
sharp.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Enq. into vulg. err. <em>l.</em> 5. <em>p.</em> 271.</div>

<p class='c008'>So that from hence it is undeniably true, that there are such
Creatures existent in nature, and have been either taken for Devils
or the Apparitions of Demons in this shape of Satyres, as Doctor
<em>Brown</em> hath well observed in these words: “A conceit there is (he
saith) that the Devil commonly appeareth with a cloven foot or
hoof, wherein although it seem excessively ridiculous, there may
be somewhat of truth; and the ground thereof at first might be
his frequent appearing in the shape of a Goat, which answers
that description. This was the opinion of ancient Christians concerning
the Apparitions of <em>Pans</em>, <em>Fauns</em> and <em>Satyres</em>, and in this
form we read of one that appeared unto <em>Antony</em> in the Wilderness.
The same is also confirmed from expositions of holy Scripture;
for whereas it is said; Thou shalt not offer unto Devils, the
original word is <em>Sehhirim</em>, that is rough and hairy Goats, because
in that shape the Devil most often appeared, as is expounded by
the Rabbins, as <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> hath also explained.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But saving the reputation of learned Saint <em>Hierome</em> and D<sup>r</sup> <em>Brown</em>,
it is but a supposition unproved that ever the Devil appeared in the
shape of a Goat, the rise of the opinion was only because the Devil
was worshipped in an Idol made in the shape of a Goat.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. In a few ages past when Popish ignorance did abound, there
was no discourse more common (which yet is continued amongst
the vulgar people) than of the apparition of certain Creatures
which they called Fayries, that were of very little stature, and being
seen would soon vanish and disappear. And these were generally
believed to be some kind of Spirits or Demons, and <em>Paracelsus</em> held
them to be a kind of middle Creatures, and called them <i><span lang="la">non-Adamicks</span></i>,
as not being of the race of <em>Adam</em>; but there are Authors
of great credit and veracity, that affirm, there have been Nations
of such people called Pygmies. And though Doctor <em>Brown</em> hath
learnedly and elegantly handled the question, “Whether there have
been or are any such dwarfish race of mankind, as but of three
spans, not considering them singly but nationally, or not, and
hath brought the most probable arguments that well can be, to
prove that there are not nor have been any such race of people
called Pygmies, yet doth he moderately conclude in these words.
There being thus (he saith) no sufficient confirmation of their
verity, some doubt may arise concerning their possibility; wherein,
since it is not defined in what dimensions the soul may exercise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>her faculties, we shall not conclude impossibility, or that there
might not be a race of Pygmies, as there is sometimes of Giants,
and so may take in the opinion of <em>Austine</em>, and his Commentator
<em>Ludovicus Vives</em>. And though <em>Kircherus</em> with his wonted impudence
do conclude in these words:” <i><span lang="la">Fabulosa itaq; sunt omnia,
quæ de hujusmodi Pygmæis veteres Geographi à simplici populo sola
relatione descripta tradiderunt</span></i>: Yet (I say) notwithstanding these
negative arguments, I give the relation of others (that are of as
great or greater credit) in the affirmative. And thus much is affirmed
by that most sagacious and learned person <em>Marcus Marci</em>, a late
Physician of no mean judgment, who saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Quicquid tamen
sit de his, Pygmæos &#38; olim fuisse, &#38; nunc esse affirmamus</span></i>. And besides
the testimony of <em>Aristotle</em>, <em>Solinus</em>, <em>Pomponius Mela</em>, and <em>Ælian</em>,
he relateth these. “But those (he saith) that have in our age viewed
the World, the same do testifie also, that there are yet Pygmies in
the Island of <em>Aruchet</em>, one of the <em>Moluccas</em>, and in the Isle <em>Cophi</em>,
and such <em>Pigasetta</em> affirmeth that he saw.” And though Doctor
<em>Brown</em> seem to sleight it, yet (according to the Proverb) <em>one eye-witness
is more to be credited than ten that have it but by the ear</em>.
<em>Odericus</em> in his History of <em>India</em> doth report also, “that there are
such people of about three spans high,” which also is confirmed
by the later <em>Odericus</em>. And to these affirmative proofs we shall
add that of the learned Philosopher and Physician <em>Baptista Van
Helmont</em>, in English thus. “A Wine Merchant (he saith) of our
Country, a very honest man, sailing sometimes to the <em>Canaries</em>
or Fortunate Islands, being asked of me his serious opinion and
judgment upon certain Creatures, which there the Children as
oft as they would did bring home, and did name them <em>Tudesquillos</em>,
or <em>Germanulos</em>, that is little men; (the Germans call them
<em>Eard-Manlins</em>) for they were dead Carkases dried almost three
foot long, which any one of the Boys did easily carry in one
hand, and were of an human shape: But the whole dead Carkase
was transparent like Parchment, and the bones were flexible as
grisles. Also the bowels and intestines were to be seen, holden
against the sun, which, when after I knew to be a certain truth,
from the Spaniards born there, I considered, that in these days the
off-spring of the Pygmies were there destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From whence all understanding and unpartial judgments may
clearly perceive, that these kind of Creatures have been really existent
in the World and are and may be so still in Islands and Mountains
that are uninhabited, and that they are no real Demons, or
<i><span lang="la">non</span></i>-Adamick Creatures, that can appear and become invisible when
they please, as <em>Paracelsus</em> thinketh. But that either they were truly
of human race endowed with the use of reason and speech (which
is most probable) or at least that they were some little kind of
Apes or Satyres, that having their secret recesses and holes in the
Mountains, could by their agility and nimbleness soon be in or out
like Conies, Weazels, Squirrels, and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>4. It hath been no less a mistake about those Fishes that are called
<em>Tritones</em>, <em>Syrenes</em>, Meirmaids, or Marine, and Sea-Men, and Women,
which have been by many supposed and taken to be Spirits, or Demons,
and commonly Nymphs, when indeed and truth they are
reall creatures, as these examples do make manifest. The first of
which we shall recite from the faithful pen of that learned Anatomist
<em>Thomas Bartholinus</em>, who was Physician to <em>Frederick</em> the
third King of <em>Denmark</em>, in these Englished words: “Various things
(he saith) of Meirmaids are extant delivered in the monuments
of the Ancients, that are partly false, partly true. It is not far
from a Fable that they held, that they did imitate the voices
of Men and Women. But that there are beasts found in the Sea,
with humane faces (he saith) I shall not deny. But I will not (he
saith) sum up the accounts of the ancients. For they are full of
the stories of Meirmaids. Amongst the later Authors, these have
here and there handled this argument, <em>Scaliger</em> (<i><span lang="la">in lib.</span></i> 2. <em>Histor.
Anim.</em> <em>t.</em> 108.) <em>Rondoletius</em>, <em>Licetus</em> (<i><span lang="la">de Spont. vin. ort.</span></i>), <em>Marcus
Marci</em> (<i><span lang="la">de Ideis</span></i>) <em>P. Boistuan</em> (<em>Histor. Gall. prod.</em> <em>T.</em> 1. <em>c.</em> 18.)
At <em>Enchuysen</em> in <em>Holland</em> (he saith) the shape of a certain Meirmaid
is to be seen painted, that formerly had been cast upon the
shore, by the force of the waters. It is (he saith) in the mouth
of our common people, that a Meirmaid was taken in <em>Denmark</em>,
that did speak, foretel things to come, and spin. A Father of
the Society of <em>Jesus</em> returning forth of <em>India</em> to <em>Rome</em>, had seen
a Sea-Man there adorned with an Episcopal Mitre, who did seem
to have in the next corner, hardly born his captivity; but being
let loose, and turned into the Sea, did seem to render thanks for
his liberty, by bowing of his body before he went under water,
which (he saith) the Jesuit was wont to tell to <em>Corvinus</em> the elder,
as his Son (he saith) told me at <em>Rome</em>.” But this being but a
story told to <em>Bartholinus</em> at the second hand, and but primarily
from the mouth of a Jesuit (who doubtless had some design in it)
I leave it to the judgment of the Wise and Prudent. But he proceeds
thus. “It is (he saith) most certain that fishes are to be
found in the Ocean, that represent Terrestrial Animals in shape:
As the Sea-Fox, the Wolf, the Sea-Calf, the Dog, the Horse, <em>&#38;c.</em>
Therefore why should we deny humane shape to Sea-monsters?
Certainly also in the earth there are Apes, which wanting
reason, do express the external shape and gestures of Man.
All Sea-monsters of this sort we referr (he saith) to the kind of
<em>Phocæ</em> or Sea-Calves. There was (he saith) in the age we live
in a Sea-Man taken by the Merchants of the <em>West-India</em> Company,
and dissected at <em>Leiden</em> by <em>Peter Pavius</em>, <em>John de Laet</em> being
present my friend (he saith) and while he lived, a great and most
knowing person of the things of <em>America</em> and of Nature. The
head and the breast even as far as the navil was of an humane
shape, but from the navil even unto the extremities, it was deformed
flesh, without the sign of a tail. But that I may not (he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>saith) seem to impose upon the Reader, the hands and ribs are to
be found in my Study or Closet, which I owe to the kindness of
the praised <i><span lang="la">Latius</span></i>. We have (he saith) annexed the Picture of
both, as well of the Meirmaid erect, as of the image of it swimming,
that we might satisfie the dubitation of all men. The hand doth
consist of five fingers, as ours do, with as many articulations as
ours, but that only is singular, that all the bones of the fingers
are broader and compressed, and a membrane doth joyn them
together in course, as in volatiles, as Geese, Ducks, <em>&#38;c.</em> which do
help to stretch forth the foot in the water. The extremity of
the two middle fingers are broader, the extremities of the other
two sharp. The <em>radius</em> and cubit are very short, for the commodiousness
of swimming, scarce the length of four fingers breadth.
Neither is the draught of the shoulder more ample. The ribs
are long and thick, almost exceeding common humane ribs a third
part.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of the ribs (he saith) are beads turned or thrown, a present
remedy for the pain of the Hemorrhoides, which the praised <i><span lang="la">Latius</span></i>
hath observed by experience. Also (he saith) that Bracelets being
made of the bones of this kind of <em>Phocas</em> carried to <em>Rome</em>, applied
to the wrist do appease the Hemicrany, and swimming of the head,
which comes again, if they be laid away, as (he saith) the most
illustrious Nobleman <em>Cassianus à Puteo</em>, (most worthy of Roman
Purple) hath told me. The same Noble <em>Puteus</em> (he saith) hath
shewed me the picture of a Meirmaid in his Closet, which not
many years before, was driven to the shore of <em>Malta</em>. A certain
Spaniard (he saith) told me, that Meirmaids were seen in <em>India</em>
having the Genital members of Women, like those of humane
kind, so that the Fishers do bind themselves with an Oath to the
Magistrate, that they have no copulation with them. <em>Bernardinus
Ginnarus</em> (<em>lib.</em> 1. <em>c.</em> 9. <i><span lang="la">de Indico itinere, edit. Neap.</span></i> 1641.)
doth relate that Meirmaids are seen, in the vast River <em>Cuama</em>,
near the head of <em>Good-hope</em>, which in the middle superior part are
like to the form of men, that is, with round head, but immediately
joyned to the breast, without a neck, with ears altogether like
ours, and so their eyes, lips and teeth. And that their dugs being
pressed do send forth most white milk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore he concludeth: “There is (he saith) so great difference
of the form of Meirmaids, with the Ancients and Moderns,
that it is no wonder, that some do account them figments. We
have (he saith) the hands to be seen with eyes, and we shew the
Meirmaids to be such, as in truth they are seen to be. Neither do
the hands and ribs deceive, whose Pictures we have given framed
according to the truth of nature.”</p>

<p class='c008'>5. But besides these there are other Fishes or Sea-monsters, that
in all parts resembled Men and Women, as these examples make
manifest. <em>Alexander ab Alexandro</em>, a person of great learning
and experience, relateth: “That in <em>Epirus</em> a <em>Triton</em> or Sea-Man was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>found, who forth of the Sea did ravish Women being alone upon
the shore: But being taken by cunning, he did resemble a Man
with all his members, but did refuse meat being offered, so that
he died with hunger and wasting, as being in a strange element.</p>

saith) with the <em>Hollanders</em>, a Sea-Man was seen of many, who also
was kept there above two years, he was mute, and then begun
to speak: But being twice smitten with the Plague, he is let
loose to the Sea rejoicing and leaping.”</p>

<p class='c008'>7. In the year of our Lord 1403. there was taken a Sea-woman
in a lake of <em>Holland</em>, thrown thither forth of the Sea, and was carried
into the City of <em>Haerlem</em>; she suffered her self to have garments
put upon her, and admitted the use of bread, milk and such like
things: Also she learned to spin, and to do many other things after
the manner of Women, also she did devoutly bend her knees
to the image of Christ crucified, being docible to all things, which
she was commanded by her Master, but living there many years,
she alwayes remained mute.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. To these we shall conclusively add one story of sufficient credit
from our own English Annals, which is this: “In the year
1187. being the 33th year of the Reign of <em>Henry</em> the second,
near unto <em>Oreford</em> in <em>Suffolk</em>, certain Fishers of the Sea took in
their nets a fish having the shape of a man in all points, which fish
was kept by <em>Bartholomew de Glanvile</em>, Custos of the Castle of
<em>Oreford</em>, in the same Castle, by the space of six months and more
for a wonder; he spake not a word. All manner of meats he did
gladly eat, but most greedily raw fish after he had crushed out
all the moisture. Oftentimes he was brought to the Church
where he shewed no tokens of adoration. At length when he
was not well looked to, he stole away to the Sea, and never after
appeared.” The learned Antiquary Mr. <em>Camden</em> tells this same
story from <em>Radulphus Coggeshall</em>, an ancient writer, and that “<i><span lang="la">Capillos
habebat, barbam prolixam &#38; pineatam, circa pectus nimium
pilosus erat, &#38; hispidus</span></i>: and concludeth: <i><span lang="la">Quicquid nascatur

<div class='sidenote'><em>Lib. de Spectr. prim. part.</em> <em>c.</em> 11. <em>p.</em> 61.</div>

<p class='c008'>By all which examples we may be rationally satisfied, that though
these creatures have a real existence in nature, yet because of their
strange natures, shapes and properties, or by reason of their being
rarely seen, they have been and often are not only by the common
people but even by the learned taken to be Devils, Spirits
or the effects of Inchantment and Witchcraft. And therefore
men that would judge aright must take heed that they be not deceived
and imposed upon by relations of this nature, and also of
all such things as may be acted by Imposture and confederacy, and
those other Physical things that are brought to pass by natural
causes, divers sorts of which are recited by <em>Ludovicus Lavaterus</em> very
largely, to which I recommend those that desire further satisfaction
in those particulars.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Of Apparitions in general, and of some unquestionable stories
that seem to prove some such things. Of those apparitions
pretended to be made in Beryls and Crystals, and of the
Astral or Sydereal Spirit.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>In this Treatise we have before sufficiently proved that the denying
of the existence of such a Witch as doth make a visible
contract with the Devil, or upon whose body he sucketh, or that
hath carnal copulation with a Demon, and that is transubstantiated
into a Cat or a Dog, or that flyeth in the air; doth not inferr the
denial of Spirits either good or bad, nor utterly overthrow the
truth of apparitions, or of such things as seem to manifest some supernatural
operations. And therefore here we shall fully handle
the question of Apparitions, and things that seem to be of that nature,
and that in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. We shall not meddle with Apparitions in the large extent of
the word, for so it may comprehend the appearing of new Stars,
Comets, Meteors and other Portents, and Prodigies, which (though
unusual and wonderous) have yet their production from natural
causes. But only here we shall treat of such apparitions as are taken
to be performed by supernatural creatures, or in such a way and
by such creatures as we commonly account to be different from (if
not above) the power of ordinary and visible nature, as of Angels
good or bad, the Souls of men departed, or their Astral Spirits,
or of some other creatures that are, or may be of a middle nature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Math. 2. 12, 13, 19.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. As for the apparitions of good Angels sent by God in times
past, both in sleep and otherwise, the Scriptures do give us most
full and ample assurance, as these few instances may undeniably demonstrate.
1. That <em>an Angel of the Lord</em> (that is a good Angel)
<em>did appear</em> visibly <em>unto Manoah and his wife</em>, and did vocally
and audibly talk and discourse with them both, and did after in
both their sights openly and visibly <em>ascend in the flame that did arise
from the altar</em>. Now a more plain and indubitable apparition visibly
seen and audibly heard than this cannot be found nor read
of, having the unquestionable authority of sacred writ to avouch
it. 2. Another parallel unto it, and of equal authority, verity and
perspicuity, is the sending of the Angel <em>Gabriel</em> unto the Virgin
<em>Mary</em>, her seeing of him, hearing of his salutation, having discourse
with him, and seeing his departure, both which are undoubted testimonies
of the true, and real appearance of good Angels even to
sight and hearing. 3. That sometimes the good Angels have been
sent to the servants of God, and have appeared and spoken unto
them in dreams; as that <em>the Angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>in a dream, and bade him to take unto him Mary his wife</em>, which
was a blessed, and clear apparition, though in a dream in his sleep.
And likewise by the appearing of an Angel unto him in a dream,
<em>he was warned to take the child, and his mother, and to flee into
Ægypt</em>, and also again <em>was commanded by an Angel, after the death
of Herod, that appeared in a dream, and bade him to take the young
child and his mother, and to go into the land of Israel</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Luk. 8 .26. to 37.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. Of the visible apparition of evil Angels we scarce have any evidence
at all in the Scriptures, except we should take supposals for
proofs, or disputable places to be certain demonstrations, or wrest
and hale the word of God to make it serve our preconceived opinions.
For I do not find any one place in all the Scriptures, where
plainly and positively any apparition of evil spirits is recorded, or
that by any rational and necessary consequence such a visible appearance
can be deduced or proved: For we have clearly proved
that the tempting of <em>Evah</em> by the Serpent doth not necessarily inferr,
that it was by a visible apparition, but by a mental delusion;
and that that of <em>Saul</em> and the Woman of <em>Endor</em>, or the Mistriss of
the bottle, was neither <em>Samuel</em> in Soul and Body, nor his Soul alone,
neither the Devil in his shape we suppose we have evinced
past answer; and that the tempting of our blessed Saviour by Satan
was internal or at least the greatest part of it; so that there
doth remain but little of certain proof of the apparition of Devils
in that gross manner, and so common and frequent as many do too
peremptorily affirm: yet for all this we think it rational to grant, that
as God hath in times past often sent messages by good Angels, for
the teaching, counselling and comforting of his servants, both audibly
and visibly to be perceived; so also that sometimes God might
not only send evil Spirits internally and mentally to deceive and
seduce the wicked, as in the case of the lying spirit in the mouth
of <em>Ahabs</em> Prophets, but also visibly to appear to terrifie, punish
and destroy the wicked, or to make way for the manifestation of
his glory. And the Scriptures that mention Demoniacks, and such
as are commonly said to be possessed, (though that were not by
an essential inhesion, but by an effective operation both upon the
Souls and Bodies of the persons that were so affected and afflicted)
do plainly shew that the operative effects of the Devils power
was both heard and seen by their words and actions. So the Devils
using the organs of the man in whom was the legion of them, <em>they
besought Christ not to command them to go out into the deep, but
besought him to suffer them to go into the herd of swine</em>: Which
“plainly sheweth that their words were audible, and were heard
of the multitude that were by, and the acts that they performed
were visible enough, for by the power of the Devil <em>he brake the
chains</em> and fetters, wherewithal he was bound, <em>and was driven
of the Devil into the wilderness</em>, and that these Devils went forth
of the man, <em>and entered in amongst the herd of swine</em>, by whose effective
power <em>the swine ran violently down a steep rock into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>sea, and were drowned</em>.” And this doth plainly manifest the present
operation of the Devils, that was apparent both by the words
and actions, that were both to be seen and heard; so that this in
that large sense, that it is usually taken in, was a real apparition
of Devils, or at least equivalent thereunto. For we do but here
inquire after such appearances of Devils, that do necessarily infer
their presence in operating so in and upon creatures or corporeal
matter, that by sight, hearing, or other of the senses, it may certainly
be manifest to work above the ordinary power of nature,
and may induce us rationally by the testimony of our senses, to believe
that those things are brought to pass by those creatures that
we call Demons, as many of these persons, who were said to have
been or to be afflicted with Devils, were in the days of our blessed
Saviours remaining in the flesh.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Heb. 1. 14.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. But though it be never so freely and fully granted, that in
the ages and times mentioned in the Old and New Testament (nay
it may be for a century or more after) there were persons that
were possessed and afflicted with Devils, and also that for that time
there were many miracles wrought: Yet now it will be said that
miracles are totally ceased as not being any way necessary to confirm
the Gospel, which is now established and setled. This we
confess is so strongly and convincingly proved by the Divines of
the reformed Churches, that we account him wilfully blind that
will oppose it. Yet notwithstanding all this that miracles are totally
ceased, I grant that there are some strange things that have
happened in late ages, and some in our own time, that cannot be
any way solved by meer ordinary natural causes, and apparitions
made by some kind of creatures that must be derived from some
such causes as those of good or bad Spirits, or from creatures of
the like nature. And that though miracles be ceased, it will not
therefore follow that every thing that hath a cause above or differing
from the usual and ordinary course of nature, must be also ceased,
for <i><span lang="la">quanquam nunc non sint miracula, possint tamen esse miranda</span></i>:
and though that miracles be ceased, yet it will not follow
that apparitions are so also, because apparitions are not miracles;
for a good Angel to be sent and to appear, cannot be said to be
a miracle, because it is the end for which he was created, they
(that is the Angels) <em>are all ministring spirits sent forth for the
good of those that shall be heirs of Salvation</em>. And it cannot be
said otherwise of evil Angels or of any other creatures that may
make these apparitions, for as they are and must be creatures, so
there is and must be some certain ends, for which they were created
and are imployed unto.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. But to prove the truth of apparitions, or other strange Phenomena’s
equivalent unto them, as to have been truly performed
as matters of fact is extream difficult and almost impossible, because
the Histories and relations of things of this nature are most strangely
fabulous, and therefore are by no means to be relied upon, as will most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>manifestly appear by undeniable reasons, if we examine them in divided
members in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The Histories and relations that are given either by the Poets,
or most of the ancient Philosophers, of these things, are so seemingly
impossible, and so extreamly fictitious, as he must of necessity
have in a manner totally forsaken his own reason, that can give
any credit at all unto them. And especially they are so fraught
with the horrible fables of the numerousness of their feigned gods,
demigods, spirits, hobgoblins, <em>Lares</em>, <em>Lemures</em>, Mens shadows and
the like, that they would make a man believe that the world was
full of nothing else, and this was chiefly done to uphold their Idolatrous
and superstitious Religion. And all these kind of authors
that have written from the time of <em>Homer</em> until the end of the ages
in which the two <em>Plinies</em> and <em>Plutarch</em> lived, have but run the same
course, all their relations tasting of the leaven of impossibilities, superstition
and fabulousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. And if we look into the Pontificial Writers, especially those
that have recorded stories of this nature since the sixth century, we
shall find such a Rhapsodie, and heap of Bombast lies and invented
fables both of apparitions and Witches, that no rational man can
well give assent to one of a thousand of them, they seem so incredible,
that they would rather make a wise man diffident of all such
matters of fact, than to yield credit to any. And a man
might as reasonably believe the forged and lying miracles of <em>Mahomet</em>,
as those monkish fables. For the extream desire that those
Authors had to advance their false and feigned Doctrine of Purgatory,
and thereby to uphold the gain and benefit that was gotten
by injoining such and such penances and eleemosynary deeds to redeem
Souls from thence, did drive them on to invent thousands of
false stories of the apparitions of Souls after death, which had not
one jot of truth in them at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Those that are called the Reformed Divines (because they returned
to that pure and true Doctrine and Worship, that had
been settled and practised in those foregoing ages that were truly
Catholick and Apostolick) being altogether intent about the main
and principal points of the Faith, and those that concerned the true
worship of God, did take little heed to the matters of this nature,
as being more circumstantial, and therefore not by them accounted
so essential and necessary. From whence it came to pass that
<em>Lambertus Danæus</em>, <em>Hemmingius</em>, <em>Erastus</em> and others, did without
due examination and circumspection receive the opinions and stories
of the Papists hand over head. From whence (I conceive) it
came to pass that <em>Ludovicus Lavaterus</em> a learned Divine of the reformed
Religion at <em>Zurich</em> did write a book of apparitions and
such matters, but brought no other proofs of the truth of these
things <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, but the often repeated stories of Heathenish Authors,
and some few from Ecclesiastick Authors, that are of dubious
credit, but not any one of his own knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>4. But if we come to consider the Histories of late that are reported
of apparitions, and such like things that must of necessity
have something in them, that resembles a supernatural cause, we
may in part receive more ample satisfaction, which will be manifest
in these few following particulars.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. <em>Meric Casaubon</em> Doctor of Divinity, in his treatise of Credulity
and Incredulity (sometimes by us quoted before) hath strongly indeavoured
to make good all those impossible and absurd things that
are ascribed unto Witches: which though he hath pitifully failed
to perform, yet hath he said enough that may serve to prove that
there are many strange things that seem to prove the being of Demons
or Spirits, though he have not brought any one story of his own
knowledge or that was done in his time. And we have shewed
before that apparitions are no certain ground for Christians to believe
the existence of Demons by, but the word of God. But in
his Preface to that piece of the relation concerning Dr. <em>Dee</em>, he relateth
two stories told by that venerable and learned Prelate Bishop
<em>Andrews</em> to his Father <em>Isaac Casaubon</em>. “The one (he saith)
concerning a noted or at least by many suspected Witch or Sorceress,
which the Devil in a strange shape did wait upon (or for
rather) at her death. The other concerning a Man, who after
his death was restored to life to make confession of a horrible
murther committed upon his own Wife, for which he had never
been suspected. And both these (he saith) that learned Bishop
did believe to be true, but for one of them it seems, he did undertake
upon his own knowledge, to wit that of the apparition,
and the other he had from an eye-witness.” And considering the
condition of Bishop <em>Andrews</em> both for learning and piety, the relations
are of much weight, and they may be seen at large in the fore-cited
Preface.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Antidot.</em> against <em>Atheis.</em> <em>c.</em> 8, 9. <em>p.</em> 209.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. I cannot but much wonder that Dr. <em>Henry Moore</em>, a grave person,
and one that for many years hath resided in a most learned and
flourishing Academy, whose name is much taken notice of both at
home and abroad, having published so many books, should make
such bad choice of the Authors from whom he takes his stories, or
that he should pitch upon those that seem so fabulous, impossible
and incredible. And that I may not seem to tax him without cause,
I desire the Reader to peruse his two relations, the one of the Shoomaker
of <em>Breslaw</em> in <em>Silesia</em>, <i><span lang="it">Anno</span></i> 1591. the other of <em>Johannes
Cuntius</em> a Citizen of <em>Pentsh</em> in <em>Silesia</em>, and to tell whether he can
rationally believe those things either to have been true or possible.
And as for the Author <i><span lang="la">Martinus Weinrichius</span></i> a Silesian Physician,
I cannot find any thing either of his fame or writings, and it is
most strange that he should be omitted by that diligent and unpartial
Author <em>Melchior Adams</em>; And there had been far better
Authors and of more credit to have pitcht upon for such like stories,
than either <em>Bodinus</em> or <em>Remigius</em>; neither can there be much
credit given to any of the stories that he relates, except it be that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>of the Pied-Piper, which some do interpret far otherwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. “There was a Treatise called, the Devil of <em>Mascon</em>, or a true
relation of the chief things which an unclean spirit did and said at
<em>Mascon</em> in <em>Burgundy</em>, in the House of M<sup>r</sup> <em>Francis Perreaud</em> Minister
of the reformed Church in the same Town, written by the
said <em>Perreaud</em> soon after the Apparition which was in the year
1612. but was not published until the year 1653. which was 41.
years after the thing was said to be acted. It seems it was translated
by D<sup>r</sup> <em>Peter Du Moulin</em>, the Son of the learned and reverend
<em>Peter Du Moulin</em>, at the request of the honourable and learned
person M<sup>r</sup> <em>Boyle</em>. The most of the things had been known unto
M<sup>r</sup> <em>Du Moulin</em> the Father, when he was President of a National
Synod in those parts, to whom also the said <em>Perreaud</em> was well
known, who was a religious, well poised, venerable Divine. And
M<sup>r</sup> <em>Boyle</em> saith, that he had had converse with this pious Author
at <em>Geneva</em>, and had inquired after the Writer, and some passages
of the Book, which overcame all his setled indisposedness to believe
strange things. The Character given of this Author, and
the assent of such learned persons to the things related, have gained
an ample suffrage to give credit to them also. But notwithstanding
all this, there are many passages in the relation that a quick-sighted
Critick would find to be either contradictory or inconsistent,
and it cannot rationally be thought that he was a Cacodemon,
his actions were so harmless, civil, and ludicrous; and if
he were to be believed (and in some things he did speak truth,
and the Minister himself M<sup>r</sup> <em>Perreaud</em> did in some things give credit
to him) he was no Devil, but hoped to be saved by Jesus
Christ. But whether a Devil or not, yet the story for substance
doth sufficiently prove the existence of such kind of Demons,
that can work strange and odd feats.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>The Saints Everlasting rest.</em> <em>c.</em> 7. <em>p.</em> 255.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. M<sup>r</sup> <em>Baxter</em> a person of great learning and piety, whose judgment
bears great sway with me, speaking of Apparitions saith thus:
“I know many are very incredulous herein, and will hardly believe
that there have been such Apparitions. For my own
part (he saith) though I am as suspicious as most in such reports,
and do believe that most of them are conceits or delusions, yet
having been very diligently inquisitive in such Cases, I have received
undoubted testimony of the truth of such Apparitions,
some from the mouths of men of undoubted honesty and godliness,
and some from the report of multitudes of persons, who
heard or saw. Were it fit here to name the persons, I could send
you to them yet living, by whom you would be as fully satisfied
as I: Houses that have been so frequently haunted with such
terrors, that the inhabitants successively have been witnesses
of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Though some of these last recited testimonies might sufficiently
convince the most obstinate and incredulous, that there are Apparitions
and some other such strange accidents that cannot be solved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>by the supposed principles of matter and motion, but that do necessarily
require some other causes, that are above or different from
the visible and ordinary course of nature; yet because it is a point
dark and mystical, and of great concern and weight, we shall add
some unquestionable testimonies, either from our own Annals, or
matters of fact that we know to be true of our own certain knowledge,
that thereby it may undoubtedly appear, that there are effects
that exceed the ordinary power of natural causes, and may for
ever convince all Atheistical minds, of which in this order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Stow.</em> <em>p.</em> 605.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. “In the first year of <em>Edward</em> the Sixth. <i><span lang="it">Anno Domini</span></i> 1551.
on St. <em>Valentines</em> day, at <em>Feversham</em> in <em>Kent</em>, one <em>Arden</em> a Gentleman
was murthered by procurement of his own Wife; for the
which fact she was the fourteenth of <em>March</em> burnt at <em>Canterbury</em>:
<em>Michael</em> M<sup>r</sup> <em>Arden</em>’s Man was hang’d in Chains at <em>Feversham</em>, and
a Maiden burnt: <em>Mosbie</em> and his Sister were hanged in <em>Smithfield</em>
at <em>London</em>: <em>Greene</em> which had fled, came again certain years after,
and was hanged in Chains in the High-way against <em>Feversham</em>, and
black <em>Will</em> the Ruffian, that was hired to do that act, after his
first escape was apprehended, and burnt on a Scaffold at <em>Flushing</em>
in <em>Zealand</em>.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>P.</em> 1708.</div>

<p class='c008'>The same horrid murther is more at large related by <em>Hollingshead</em>,
who lived at that time, and had information of all the particulars,
who saith thus much more. “This one thing (he saith) seemeth very
strange and notable touching M<sup>r</sup> <em>Arden</em>, that in the place he was
laid, being dead, all the proportion of his body might be seen two
years after and more, so plain as could be, for the grass did not
grow where his body had touched, but between his legs, between
his arms and about the hollowness of his neck, and round about
his body: And where his legs, arms, head, or any part of his body
had touched, no grass growed at all of all that time. So that
many strangers came in that mean time, beside the Townsmen, to
see the print of his body there on the ground in that Field, which
Field he had (as some have reported) cruelly taken from a Woman,
that had been a Widdow to one <em>Cooke</em>, and after Married to
one <em>Richard Read</em> a Marriner, to the great hinderance of her and
her Husband the said <em>Read</em>, for they had long enjoyed it by a
Lease which they had of it for many years not then expired. Nevertheless
he got it from them, for the which, the said <em>Reads</em>
Wife not only exclaimed against him in shedding many a salt tear,
but also cursed him most bitterly even to his face, wishing many
a vengeance to light upon him, and that all the World might
wonder on him, which was thought then to come to pass, when
he was thus murthered and lay in that Field, from midnight till
the morning, and so all that day, being the Fair-day, till night, all
the which day there were many hundreds of people came wondring
about him.” From whence we may take this Observation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>As it is most certain that this is a true and punctual relation given
us by <em>Hollingshead</em>, as being a publick thing done in the face of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Nation, the print of his body remaining so long after, and viewed and
wondered at by so many; so that it hath not left the least starting
hole for the most incredulous Atheist to get out at. So likewise it
may dare the most deep-sighted Naturalist, or unbelieving Atheist,
that would exalt and so far deifie Nature, as to deny and take away
the existence of the God of Nature, to shew a reason of the long remaining
of the print of his body, or the not growing of the grass
in those places where his body had touched for two years and more
after? Could it be the steams or Atoms that flowed from his body?
then are why not such prints left by other murthered bodies? which
we are sure by sight and experience not to be so. And therefore
we can attribute it justly to no other cause but only to the power
of God and divine vengeance, who is a righter of the oppressed,
fatherless and Widdows, and hears their cries and regardeth their
tears.</p>

murtherers, which was this; One <em>Anne Waters</em> enticed by a lover
of hers, consented to have her Husband strangled, and then buried
him secretly under the Dunghil in a Cow-house. Whereupon
the man being missing by his Neighbours, and the Wife making
shew of a wondering what was become of him, it pleased God
that one of the inhabitants of the Town dreamed one night that
his Neighbour <em>Waters</em> was strangled, and buried under the Dunghill

who together with many more, who both remember and can affirm
every particular thereof, the Narrative was taken <em>April</em> the <em>17th
1663</em>, and is this,</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the year abovesaid, <em>John Waters</em> of <em>Lower Darwen</em> in the
County of <em>Lancaster</em> Gardiner, by reason of his calling was much
absent from his Family: In which his absence, his Wife (not without
cause) was suspected of incontinency with one <em>Gyles Haworth</em>
of the same Town; this <em>Gyles Haworth</em> and <em>Waters</em> Wife conspired
and contrived the death of <em>Waters</em> in this manner. They contracted
with one <em>Ribchester</em> a poor man to kill this <em>Waters</em>. As soon
as <em>Waters</em> came home and went to bed, <em>Gyles Haworth</em> and <em>Waters</em>
Wife conducted the hired Executioner to the said <em>Waters</em>. Who
seeing him so innocently laid betwixt his two small Children in
Bed, repented of his enterprize, and totally refused to kill him.
<em>Gyles Haworth</em> displeased with the faint-heartedness of <em>Ribchester</em>,
takes the Axe into his own hand, and dashed out his brains: The
Murderers buried him in a Cow-house, <em>Waters</em> being long missing
the Neighbourhood asked his Wife for him; she denied that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>knew where he was. Thereupon publick search was made for him
in all pits round about, lest he should have casually fallen into any
of them. One <em>Thomas Haworth</em> of the said Town Yeoman, was
for many nights together, much troubled with broken sleeps and
dreams of the murder; he revealed his dreams to his Wife, but she
laboured the concealment of them a long time: This <em>Thomas
Haworth</em> had occasion to pass by the House every day where the
murder was done, and did call and inquire for <em>Waters</em>, as often
as he went near the House. One day he went into the House to
ask for him, and there was a Neighbour who said to <em>Thomas Haworth</em>,
It’s said that <em>Waters</em> lies under this stone, (pointing to the
Hearth-stone) to which <em>Thomas Haworth</em> replied, And I have
dreamed that he is under a stone not far distant. The Constable
of the said Town being accidentally in the said House (his name
<em>Myles Aspinall</em>) urged <em>Thomas Haworth</em> to make known more at
large what he had dreamed, which he relateth thus. I have (quoth
he) many a time within this eight weeks (for so long it was since
the murder) dreamed very restlessly, that <em>Waters</em> was murdered
and buried under a broad stone in the Cow-house; I have told my
troubled dreams to my Wife alone, but she refuses to let me make
it known: But I am not able to conceal my dreams any longer, my
sleep departs from me, I am pressed and troubled with fearful
dreams which I cannot bear any longer, and they increase upon
me. The Constable hearing this made search immediately upon it,
and found as he had dreamed the murdered body eight weeks buried
under a flat stone in the Cow-house; <em>Ribchester</em> and <em>Gyles Haworth</em>
fled and never came again. <em>Anne Waters</em> (for so was <em>Waters</em>
Wifes name) being apprehended, confessed the murder, and was
burned.” From whence we may observe this.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. That this is the full and punctual relation of this bloody and
execrable murder from <em>Haworths</em> Wife (who then was a very old
Woman) and the Son, and differs not a jot from what Sir <em>Richard
Baker</em> writes, but only they say his brains were dashed out with an
Axe, and he saith he was strangled, which is only a circumstance of
the manner, but in the matter they both agree, that it was a certain
truth that <em>Waters</em> was murdered, and Sir <em>Richard Bakers</em> information
might fail in that particular of the manner of it. And if it be
thought strange that the two little Children did know nothing of
it, it is certain that they were much too young, and said that they
were twins, not above half a year old. But the only matter that
we have brought it for, is the extraordinary way of its discovery
by <em>Thomas Haworths</em> dreaming, in which point both the relations
closely agree, and was the chief and only reason why Sir <em>Richard
Baker</em> put it in his Chronicle. And the same also more at large <em>Stow</em>
hath recorded in his Chronicle. Now what should the cause be
that <em>Thomas Haworth</em> should be hindred of his sleep, and have restless
dreams, and that his dream should hit so punctually of the place
where he was buried, more than any other person in the same Town?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>certainly it cannot be referred to fortune and chance, for they have
no causality at all, and are but only names that we impose upon certain
effects and accidents: <i><span lang="la">Te facimus fortuna Deum, cœloq; locamus</span></i>,
as said the Poet. Neither can it rationally be thought to be
melancholy, because that though it be a subtil humour, and render
those that are affected therewith very imaginative and thoughtful,
yet supposing <em>Thomas Haworth</em> to be of that temperament and
disposition, it might make him more deeply to think and meditate
upon the rumour of <em>Waters</em> being awanting or upon suspicion of
his murder, but could not in dreams inform him to know precisely
the place where he was buried. And if some should imagine it
to be the Soul of the murthered person <em>Waters</em>, as doubtless a Papist
would be ready to affirm, yet is that opinion directly contrary
to the Scriptures, and sufficiently confuted by the reformed Divines.
And if it should be referred to the operation of the Astral or
Sydereal spirit, that is an opinion but imbraced by few, and is hard
to prove to be a certain verity, of which we shall speak largely anon.
Neither can it by any sound reason be thought to be the Devil,
because it is manifest that God doth not use the ministry of evil
Angels for any good end, as for the discovery of murther, and
the bringing of the guilty persons to condign punishment; but on
the contrary he useth their service for to tempt, seduce, deceive,
punish and torment. Therefore we conceive that it was brought
to pass by the finger of God, who either immediately by himself,
or by the ministry of a good Angel, did represent those dreams to
<em>Thomas Haworth</em>, and revealed the precise place of <em>Waters</em> burial.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. “About the year of our Lord 1623 or 24 one <em>Fletcher</em> of
<em>Rascal</em>, a Town in the North Riding of <em>Yorkshire</em> near unto the
Forest of <em>Gantress</em>, a Yeoman of good Estate, did marry a young
lusty Woman from <em>Thornton Brigs</em>, who had been formerly kind
with one <em>Ralph Raynard</em>, who kept an Inn within half a mile from
<em>Rascall</em> in the high road way betwixt <em>York</em> and <em>Thuske</em>, his Sister
living with him. This <em>Raynard</em> continued in unlawful lust with
the said <em>Fletchers</em> Wife, who not content therewith conspired the
death of <em>Fletcher</em>, one <em>Mark Dunn</em> being made privy and hired
to assist in the murther. Which <em>Raynard</em> and <em>Dunn</em> accomplished
upon the <em>May-day</em> by drowning <em>Fletcher</em>, as they came all
three together from a Town called <em>Huby</em>, and acquainting the
wife with the deed she gave them a Sack therein to convey his
body, which they did and buried it in <em>Raynards</em> backside or Croft
where an old Oak-root had been stubbed up, and sowed Mustard seed
upon the place thereby to hide it. So they continued their
wicked course of lust and drunkenness, and the neighbours did much
wonder at <em>Fletchers</em> absence, but his wife did excuse it, and said
that he was but gone aside for fear of some Writs being served
upon him. And so it continued until about the seventh day of
<em>July</em>, when <em>Raynard</em> going to <em>Topcliffe</em> Fair, and setting up his
Horse in the Stable, the spirit of <em>Fletcher</em> in his usual shape and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>habit did appear unto him, and said, Oh <em>Raph</em>, repent, repent,
for my revenge is at hand; and ever after until he was put in the
Gaol, it seemed to stand before him, whereby he became sad and
restless: And his own Sister over-hearing his confession and relation
of it to another person, did through fear of losing her own
life, immediately reveal it to Sir <em>William Sheffield</em>, who lived in
<em>Rascall</em>, and was a Justice of Peace. Whereupon they were all
three apprehended and sent to the Gaol at <em>York</em>, where they
were all three condemned, and so executed accordingly near to
the place where <em>Raynard</em> lived, and where <em>Fletcher</em> was buried,
the two men being hung up in irons, and the woman buried under
the Gallows.” I have recited this story punctually as a thing
that hath been very much fixed in my memory, being then but
young, and as a certain truth, I being (with many more) an ear-witness
of their confessions and an eye-witness of their Executions,
and likewise saw <em>Fletcher</em> when he was taken up, where they had
buried him in his cloaths, which were a green fustian doublet pinkt
upon white, gray breeches, and his walking boots and brass spurrs
without rowels.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>Some will say there was no extrinsick apparition to <em>Raynard</em> at
all, but that all this did only arise from the guilt of his own conscience,
which represented the shape of <em>Fletcher</em> in his fancy. But
then why was it precisely done at that time, and not at any others?
it being far from the place of the murder, or the place where they
had buried <em>Fletcher</em>, and nothing there that might bring it to his
remembrance more than at another time, and if it had only arisen
from within, and appeared so in his fancy, it had been more likely to
have been moved, when he was in, or near his backside where the
murthered body of <em>Fletcher</em> lay. But certain it is that he affirmed
that it was the shape and voice of <em>Fletcher</em>, as assuredly to his eyes
and ears, as ever he had seen or heard him in his life. And if it
were granted that it was only intrinsick, yet that will not exclude
the Divine Power, which doubtless at that time did labour
to make him sensible of the cruel murther, and to mind him of the revenge
approaching. And it could not be brought to pass either by
the Devil, or <em>Fletchers</em> Soul, as we have proved before; and therefore
in reason we conclude that either it was wrought by the Divine
Power, to shew his detestation of murther, or that it was the Astral
or Sydereal Spirit of <em>Fletcher</em>, seeking revenge for the murther, of
which more anon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. About the year of our Lord 1632. (as near as I can remember
having lost my notes, and the copy of the Letter to Serjeant
<em>Hutton</em>, but am sure that I do most perfectly remember the substance
of the story) near unto <em>Chester</em> in the street, there lived
“one <em>Walker</em> a Yeoman-man of good Estate, and a Widower, who
had a young Woman to his Kinswoman that kept his House, who
was by the Neighbours suspected to be with child, and was towards
the dark of the evening one night sent away with one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span><em>Mark Sharp</em> who was a Collier, or one that digged coals under
ground, and one that had been born in <em>Blakeburn</em> Hundred in
<em>Lancashire</em>, and so she was not heard of a long time, and no noise,
or little was made about it. In the winter time after one <em>James
Graham</em> or <em>Grime</em> (for so in that Country they call them) being
a Miller, and living about two miles from the place where <em>Walker</em>
lived, was one night alone very late in the Mill grinding Corn,
and as about twelve or one a clock at night he came down the
stairs from having been putting Corn in the Hopper, the Mill
doors being shut, there stood a Woman upon the midst of the
floor with her hair about her head, hanging down, and all bloody,
with five large wounds in her head: He being much affrighted
and amazed, begun to bless him, and at last asked her who she
was, and what she wanted; to which she said, I am the Spirit of
such a Woman, who lived with <em>Walker</em>, and being got with
child by him, he promised me to send me to a private place, where
I should be well lookt to until I was brought in bed, and well
again, and then I should come again, and keep his house. And
accordingly (said the apparition) I was one night late sent away
with one <em>Mark Sharp</em>, who upon a Moor (naming a place that
the Miller knew) slew me with a pick (such as men dig coals
withal) and gave me these five wounds, and after threw my body
into a coal-pit hard by; and hid the pick under a bank; and his
shoos and stockings being bloody he endeavoured to wash, but
seeing the blood would not wash forth he hid them there. And
the apparition further told the Miller that he must be the Man to
reveal it, or else that she must still appear, and haunt him. The
Miller returned home very sad and heavy, but spoke not one
word of what he had seen, but eschewed as much as he could to
stay in the Mill within night without company, thinking thereby
to escape the seeing again of that frightful apparition. But
notwithstanding one night when it begun to be dark, the apparition
met him again, and seemed very fierce and cruel, and threatned
him that if he did not reveal the murder she would continually
pursue and haunt him. Yet for all this he still concealed it,
until S. <em>Thomas</em> Eve before <em>Christmas</em>, when being soon after Sunset
walking in his Garden she appeared again, and then so threatened
and affrighted him that he faithfully promised to reveal it
next morning. In the morning he went to a Magistrate and made
the whole matter known with all the circumstances, and diligent
search being made, the body was found in a coal-pit, with five
wounds in the head, and the pick and shooes and stockings yet
bloody, in every circumstance as the apparition had related unto
the Miller. Whereupon <em>Walker</em> and <em>Mark Sharp</em> were both
apprehended, but would confess nothing. At the Assizes following
(I think it was at <em>Durham</em>) they were arraigned, found guilty,
condemned and executed, but I could never hear that they
confessed the fact. There were some that reported that the apparition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>did appear to the Judge or the Foreman of the Jury,
(who was alive in <em>Chester</em> in the street about ten years ago, as I
have been credibly informed) but of that I know no certainty.”
There are many persons yet alive that can remember this strange
murder, and the discovery of it, for it was, and sometimes yet is
as much discoursed of in the North Countrey as any thing that almost
hath ever been heard of, and the relation printed, though now
not to be gotten. I relate this with the greater confidence (though
I may fail in some of the circumstances) because I saw and read
the Letter that was sent to Serjeant <em>Hutton</em>, who then lived at
<em>Goldsbrugh</em> in <em>Yorkshire</em>, from the Judge before whom <em>Walker</em> and
<em>Mark Sharp</em> were tried, and by whom they were condemned, and
had a Copy of it until about the year 1658. when <em>I</em> had it and many
other books and papers taken from me.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Rom. 11. 33.</div>

<p class='c008'>And this I confess to be one of the most convincing stories (being
of undoubted verity) that ever I read, heard or knew of, and
carrieth with it the most evident force to make the most incredulous
spirit, to be satisfied that there are really sometimes such things
as apparitions. And though it be not easy to assign the true and
proper cause of such a strange effect, yet must we not measure all
things to be, or not to be, to be true or false, according to the extent
of our understandings, for if there be many of the <em>magnalia
naturæ</em> that yet lie hidden from the wisest of men, then much more
may the <em>magnalia Dei</em> be unknown unto us, <em>whose judgments are
unsearchable, and his wayes past finding out</em>. And as in the rest we
cannot ascribe this strange apparition, to any diabolical operation,
nor to the Soul of the Woman murthered, so we must conclude
that either it was meerly wrought by the Divine Power, or by the
Astral spirit of the murthered Woman, which last doth seem most
rational, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. To these (though it be not altogether of the same nature)
we shall add one both for the oddness and strangeness of it, as also
because it happened in my time, and I was both an eye and ear-witness
of the trial of the person accused. And first take a hint of it
from the pen of <em>Durant Hotham</em>, in his learned Epistle to the <i><span lang="la">Mysterium
magnum</span></i> of <em>Jacob Behemen</em> upon <em>Genesis</em> in these words:
“There was (he saith) as I have heard the story credibly reported
in this Country a Man apprehended for suspicion of Witchcraft,
he was of that sort we call white Witches, which are such as do
cures beyond the ordinary reasons and deductions of our usual
practitioners, and are supposed (and most part of them truly)
to do the same by the ministration of spirits (from whence under
their noble favours, most Sciences at first grew) and therefore
are by good reason provided against by our Civil Laws, as being
ways full of danger and deceit, and scarce ever otherwise obtained
than by a devillish compact of the exchange of ones Soul
to that assistant spirit, for the honour of its Mountebankery.
What this man did was with a white powder which, he said, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>received from the Fairies, and that going to a Hill he knocked
three times, and the Hill opened, and he had access to, and converse
with a visible people; and offered, that if any Gentleman
present would either go himself in person, or send his servant, he
would conduct them thither, and shew them the place and persons
from whom he had his skill.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. 1 Jacob.</em> <em>c.</em> 12.</div>

<p class='c008'>To this I shall only add thus much, that the man was accused for
invoking and calling upon evil spirits, and was a very simple and
illiterate person to any mans judgment, and had been formerly very
poor, but had gotten some pretty little meanes to maintain
himself, his Wife and diverse small children, by his cures done
with this white powder, of which there were sufficient proofs,
and the Judge asking him how he came by the powder, he told a
story to this effect. “That one night before day was gone, as he
was going home from his labour, being very sad and full of heavy
thoughts, not knowing how to get meat and drink for his
Wife and Children, he met a fair Woman in fine cloaths, who
asked him why he was so sad, and he told her that it was by reason
of his poverty, to which she said, that if he would follow
her counsel she would help him to that which would serve to
get him a good living; to which he said he would consent with
all his heart, so it were not by unlawful ways: she told him that
it should not be by any such ways, but by doing of good and curing
of sick people; and so warning him strictly to meet her there
the next night at the same time, she departed from him, and he
went home. And the next night at the time appointed he duly
waited, and she (according to promise) came and told him that
it was well that he came so duly, otherwise he had missed of that
benefit, that she intended to do unto him, and so bade him follow
her and not be afraid. Thereupon she led him to a little Hill
and she knocked three times, and the Hill opened, and they went
in, and came to a fair hall, wherein was a Queen sitting in great
state, and many people about her, and the Gentlewoman that
brought him, presented him to the Queen, and she said he was
welcom, and bid the Gentlewoman give him some of the white
powder, and teach him how to use it, which she did, and gave
him a little wood box full of the white powder, and bad him
give 2 or 3 grains of it to any that were sick, and it would heal
them, and so she brought him forth of the Hill, and so they parted.
And being asked by the Judge whether the place within the Hill,
which he called a Hall, were light or dark, he said indifferent,
as it is with us in the twilight; and being asked how he got
more powder, he said when he wanted he went to that Hill, and
knocked three times, and said every time I am coming, I am
coming, whereupon it opened, and he going in was conducted
by the aforesaid Woman to the Queen, and so had more powder
given him. This was the plain and simple story (however it may
be judged of) that he told before the Judge, the whole Court,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>and the Jury, and there being no proof, but what cures he had
done to very many, the Jury did acquit him: and I remember the
Judge said, when all the evidence was heard, that if he were to
assign his punishment, he should be whipped from thence to Fairyhall,
and did seem to judge it to be a delusion or an Imposture.”
From whence we may take these observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. Though Mr. <em>Hotham</em> seem to judge that this person accused
had the white powder from some Spirit, and that one also of the
evil sort, and upon a contract, by the ingaging of his Soul, we
have before sufficiently proved the nullity of a visible and corporeal
contract with the Devil; neither was it yet ever proved that the Devil
did any good either real or apparent, but is the sworn enemy
of all mankind, both in their Souls and in their Bodies, but this
powder wrought that which was really good, namely the curing
of diseases, and therefore rationally cannot be thought to be given
from an evil spirit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Some there were that thought that the simple man told a plain
and true story, and that he had the powder from those people we
call Fairies, and there are many that do believe and affirm that there
are such people, of whom <em>Paracelsus</em> hath a Treatise of purpose,
holding that they are not of the seed of <em>Adam</em>, and therefore he
calls them <i><span lang="la">non</span></i>-Adamicks, and that they have flesh and bones, and
so differ from spirits, and yet that they can glide through walls and
rocks (which he calleth their Chaos) as easily as we through the
air, and that they get children, and are mortal like those that
<em>Hieronynus Cardanus</em> relateth that appeared to his Father <em>Facius
Cardanus</em>, and these he calleth <em>Pygmæi</em>, <em>Silvestres</em>, <em>Gnomi</em> and <em>Umbratiles</em>;
but his proof of their existence to me doth not seem satisfactory,
what others may think of it I leave to their demonstrations,
if they have any.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Some there were (and those not of the meer ignorant sort)
that did judge, that though the Man was simple, yet that the story
that he told was but framed and taught him, the better to conceal
the person from whom he received the white powder. For they
thought that some notable Chymist, or rather an Adeptist, had
in charity bestowed that powder upon him, for the relief of himself
and family, as we know it hath often happened to other persons, at
other times and places. And this last opinion seems most consonant
to reason, and I the rather believe it because not many years
after, it was certainly known, that there was an Adeptist in that
Countrey, and we ought not to fetch in supernatural causes to solve
effects, when natural causes may serve the turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The last thing of this strange nature, that we shall instance in,
is concerning the bleeding or cruentation of the bodies of those
that have been murthered, I mean of such as have been murthered
by prepense malice, and upon premeditated purpose; for the bodies
of others that are killed by chance-medley, and by man-slaughter,
we do not read nor find any examples, that ever their bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>did bleed. And though we have not been ocular witness of any
such bleeding yet are there records of such accidents given us by
many learned and credible authors that a man might almost be accounted
an Infidel not to give credit to them, and that both of
those that have bled when the murtherer hath not been present,
and also of those that have bled the murtherer being present. And
first of those bodies that have issued blood, when the murtherer was
not by.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Gregorius Horstius</em> a Physician of great experience and learning,
and of no less integrity, recordeth this story, thus Englished. “In
the year of our Lord 1604. twenty sixth day of <em>December</em>, a
young Nobleman of twenty five years old, was shot at with a
Gun in the night time about nine a clock from an high window
of an house, in the Town of <em>Blindmarck</em> in lower <em>Austria</em>, and the
bullet entring his left breast went forth at his right side, and so
forthwith died in the place. The dead body being viewed again,
and the wound considered, the same quantity or bigness both of
the entrance and out-going are found with great plenty of blood
issuing. The following day being the twenty seventh of <em>December</em>
in the morning, the body of the murthered young man hath
other cloaths put upon it and so is kept quiet for the space of
two days. Furthermore upon the thirtieth of <em>December</em> he is laid
upon the Bier, and kept in the Church and that without any
further motion, where nevertheless from the upper wound the
fresh blood did daily flow, until the eighth of <em>January</em> 1605. from
which time the Hemorrhage ceased. But again the thirteenth of
<em>February</em>, about noon, the flux of blood by the lower wound for
an hour or two was observed to issue, as though the slaughter had
been newly done. In the mean time the habit of the whole body
was such, as did most easily agree to what it was living, the colour
of his face remained even unto his burial ruddy and florid,
the vein appearing in his forehead filled with good blood: no
sign of an incipient putrefaction appearing for so many weeks, no
stink, or ungrateful odour, which otherwise doth accompany
dead bodies within a few days, was here found at all: The fingers
of the hands remained soft, moveable, or flexible, without
any wast, the natural colour being not very much changed, except
that in process of time, about the last week before burial,
they begun in a certain manner to wax livid in the extremities.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 7.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>p.</em> 154.</div>

<p class='c008'>7. This following he giveth to prove, that as cold constringeth
and shuteth up the veins, so heat doth open them, and cause the
blood to flow, and saith: “This is proved a few years since by experience
in an infant slain by a most wicked Mother forthwith after
it was born, and thrown from the Tower of a Noble Baron of
upper <em>Austria</em> into a ditch that was full with water; which after
five weeks by good fortune was found and taken out. And forthwith
(he saith) the Mother not present, it being then not known
who was the Mother, when it felt the force of the external air, it begun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>to distil forth very fresh blood, because the pores, which by reason
of the cold, were shut that the blood could not flow, were then
unlockt and opened by the heat of the ambient air.” And thus
much of those that have bled, the murtherers not being present.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Next we shall give some examples of those that have bled
when the murtherers have been brought into the presence of the body
murthered or caused to touch it, and this <em>Franciscus Valeriola</em> doth
attest with an ample faith that he himself saw: “When (he saith)
<em>James</em> of <em>Aqueria</em>, a Senator of <em>Arles</em>, was found dead of a wound,
&#38; that he that gave that wound was apprehended by the Magistrate,
and brought into the view of the dead body, that he might acknowledge
the person murthered and confess the fact, by and by the bubbling
blood, all the by-standers looking on, begun to come forth,
with much fervour and bubbles, from the wound and the nostrils.”</p>

manner: “In the year 1607 the 25 of <em>April</em>, a certain Shepherd in
<em>Spain</em> being feeding his flock was slain by two Noblemen, and his
body thrown into a company of bushes. The Judges of the same
place, having much and daily sought the Shepherd, after four
days at length find his body in the bushes. But because that murder
was committed, no witnesses being by, the suspicion fell upon
the two Noblemen, inhabiting in the nearest place, who being taken
were haled to the body of the person murthered. But what
comes to pass? The first scarce with his eyes had looked upon the
dead body, but behold, the blood in plenty begun to flow from
thence. But the other coming near, the very right hand of the
person murthered did first of all shew to those that were by the
wound, and afterward the murderer himself. Which being done,
forthwith the two Gentlemen (or Nobles) did of their own accord
confess that they were the Authors of the murther, and did receive
the punishment that was worthy of their deeds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>10. Another very remarkable one we have from the same Author
cited from <em>Cantipratanus</em> <em>lib.</em> 2. <em>mirac. c.</em> 29. in this manner. “It
happened (the Author saith) in the year of Christ 1271. in the
Town <span class='blackletter'>Pforzheim</span>, that a certain most wicked old Woman familiar
with the Jews, did sell them a girl of seven years old, and
without parents, to be slain. Her therefore in secret her mouth
being stopt, setting her upon linnen cloaths, they wound almost
in all the junctures of the members with incisions, and with great
endeavour press forth the blood, and receive it most diligently in
the linnen cloaths. But she being dead after great pains, the
Jews throw her body into a running water near the Town, and
laid an heap of Stones upon it. But after the third or fourth day
her body is found by Fishers, by means of her hand stretched forth
towards Heaven, and carried into the Town, the people with abomination
crying forth that so great a wickedness was perpetrated
by the Jews. And the Marquiss of <em>Baden</em> being near, went
unto the Corps, and straightway the body standing upright did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>stretch forth its hands unto the Prince, as though it would implore
the revengment of blood, or perhaps mercy. But after half
an hour it disposed it self upon its back, after the manner of those
that are dead. Therefore the wicked Jews being brought to the
spectacle, forthwith all the wounds of the body burst forth,
and in testimony of the horrid murder, poured forth great plenty
of blood, whereupon the Jews were put to death.”</p>

our Saviour 1503. a certain Inn-keeper, by name <em>Buggerlinus</em>, with
whom a certain poor Merchant or Pedlar had laid up his money or
stock, occasion being taken by the Inn-keeper he kills him in a
Wood, and buries him privately; but afterwards when he was
found, the suspicion of the murther fell upon the Inn-keeper. For
that Pedlar had a bended knife or dagger at his girdle, which
they took, and shewed to the Inn-keeper, asking him, if he knew
it? But behold assoon as he took it in his hand, it sweat drops of
blood, whereby the murtherer being affrighted, confessed the
murther, and so was Executed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>12. We have also a punctual History to this purpose, related by
<em>Hollingshead</em>, <em>Stow</em>, and <em>Sir Richard Baker</em>, from <em>Roger of Winchester</em>,
of King <em>Henry</em> the second, which is this: “This King, when he
was carried forth to be buried was first apparelled in his Princely
Robes, having his Crown on his Head, Gloves on his Hands,
and Shoes on his Feet wrought with Gold, Spurs on his Heels,
a Ring of Gold on his Finger, a Scepter in his Hand, a Sword by
his Side, and so was laid uncovered having a pleasant countenance:
which when it was told to his Son <em>Richard</em>, he came with
all speed to see him, and as soon as he came near him, the blood
gushed out of the nose of the dead Corps in great plenty, even as
if the spirit of the dead King had disdained and abhorred the
presence of him, who was thought to be the chief cause of his
death. Which thing caused the said <em>Richard</em> to weep bitterly,
and he caused his Fathers body to be honourably buried at <i><span lang="co">Fonteverard</span></i>.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 13.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>13. The last story that we shall relate of this nature, is from a
Minister that is learned, sincere and of great veracity, who had it from
those that were eye-witnesses, and is this: “In the year of our
Lord God, 1661. <em>January</em> 30th on <em>Saturday</em> at night about nine of
the Clock, did <em>John How</em> of <em>Bruzlington-Bank</em>, at the foot of
an Hill (which is about two miles distant from <em>Bishop-Awkland</em>) murther
<em>Ralph Gawkley</em>, who was a Glover in <em>Bishop-Awkland</em>: This
<em>How</em> was the next day apprehended and brought to touch <em>Gawkleys</em>
Corps, the lips and nostrils of the dead body wrought and
opened as he touched (which made him afraid to touch the second
time) then presently the Corps bled abundantly at the nostrils
in the sight of Mr. <em>Robert Harrison</em> the Coroner (now Tenant
at <em>Bishop-Awkland</em> to Mr. <em>Franckland</em>, from whom I had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>relation) of <em>Anthony Cummin</em> and his Brother, &#38;c. of the Jury,
and of a great many towns people, who were then present. So
<em>How</em> was Executed the next Assizes after at <em>Durham</em>: Witnesses
against him were <em>Anne Wall</em>, whom he also wounded, yet
she escaped with her life, and <em>How</em>’s own Wife, at the motion
of her own Father (a very honest Man) who bid her tell the truth,
and she should never want help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Some may think that I have been too large and tedious in heaping
so many stories concerning the bleeding of the bodies of those
that have been murthered; but I did it for this reason, because there
are many that think it but to be a Fable of the credulous vulgar,
and others think that it is but an ordinary matter that happens to
any bodies that are dead, and no extraordinary or supernatural thing
in it at all. But whosoever shall but use so much patience, as seriously
to read and consider these select Histories that we have recited,
may easily be satisfied, both that such bleeding is absolutely true <i><span lang="la">de
facto</span></i>, and also that there is something more than ordinary in it, and
therefore we shall inlarge in these observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. It will not be found to hold touch upon diligent observation
and strict inquiry, that all dead bodies do bleed fresh and rosie
blood, especially after the third or fourth day, or after some weeks,
as divers of the instances above given do manifestly prove; and
therefore is an accident incident to some dead bodies and not to all.
And it will as far fail, that wounded bodies, that have been slain in the
wars, after the natural heat be gone, will upon motion bleed any
fresh or crimson blood at all; for we our selves in the late times of
Rebellion have seen some thousands of dead bodies, that have had
divers wounds, and lying naked and being turned over and over, and
by ten or twelve thrown into one pit, and yet not one of them have
issued any fresh and pure blood: Only from some of their wounds,
some sanious matter would have flowed, putrefaction beginning by
reason of the moisture and acidity in the air, but no pure blood,
and therefore is not a common accident to all humane bodies that
die naturally or violently, but only is peculiar to some, and especially
to those that are murthered by prepensed malice, as appeareth
in the Histories recited above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. We shall acknowledge with <em>Gregorius Horstius</em>, <em>Sperlingius</em>
and <em>Gothofredus Voigtius</em>, that sometimes the bodies of those that
have been murthered do bleed, when the murtherer is not present, as
is manifest from the sixth History recited from <em>Horstius</em> of the young
Man of twenty five years old, that bled so long and so often,
though the murtherer was not present; from whence they conclude
that the presence of the murtherer, is not a necessary cause of the
bleeding of the murthered body; and therefore that the bleeding
of the body is not always a certain and infallible sign of discovering
the murtherer? To which we reply, that the issuing of fresh
and crimson blood from the wound or the nostrils of the persons
body that hath been murthered, is always a certain sign that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Corps that doth so bleed was murthered, because those that die
naturally or violently by chance, man-slaughter or in the war, do
not bleed, as hath been proved before. Again, if the murtherer be
certainly known, or have confessed the crime, in regard of the final
cause which is discovery, there is no reason why the Corps should
bleed: And though the presence of the murtherer may not be the
efficient cause why the Corps doth bleed, yet is it the occasional,
as is manifest undeniably by sundry of the Histories that we have
related, where the murtherers had not been certainly known but by
the bleeding of the body murthered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Whereas the three Authors above named, thinking they have
sufficiently confuted those that ascribed this effect of the bleeding
of the dead body to Sympathy or Antipathy, or to the moving of
the bodies, or heat in the air; have assigned the cause to be the
beginning of putrefaction in the bodies murthered, by which a new
motion is caused in the humors, and so in the blood, by which means
it floweth afresh: against this these two reasons oppose themselves.
1. Must putrefaction needs begin at that very moment,
when the murtherer toucheth the body? For in divers of them
there was no bleeding until the murtherers were present or did
touch the bodies, and their touching could not cause the beginning
of putrefaction, and soon after their removing the bleeding hath
ceased, so that putrescence <i><span lang="la">in fieri</span></i> cannot be the cause of the fresh
bleeding. 2. Putrefaction beginning could not be the cause why
the murthered Shepherds body in the ninth History should with
its hands point to the wound, and to the murtherers, nor that the
hands of the Wench murthered by the Jews, in the tenth History,
should be stretched forth to the Prince of <em>Baden</em>, or that the Lips
and Nostrils of the Body of <em>Gawkley</em> should work and open at the
touch of the murtherer <em>How</em>; this must of necessity proceed from
some higher cause than putrefaction, or any other they have laid
down.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Append. de Cru. Cadav.</em> <em>p.</em> 154.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. But though it should be acknowledged, that in some of these
bleedings there were something that were extraordinary or supernatural,
yet as learned <em>Horstius</em> tells us: “It is (he saith) an inconvenient
Tenent of those that hold, that the Souls of those that
are murthered, wandering about the Bodies, by reason of the hatred
they bear towards those that were their murtherers, do cause
these bleedings: but this in Philosophy cannot stand, because
the separate form can by no means operate upon the subject any
longer. And (he saith) the same thing in Theologie seems to be
very impious; because the Souls of the dead are without mundane
conversation, as is sufficiently manifest from the History of
the Rich Man and <em>Lazarus</em>, <em>Luke</em> 16.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>“5. And if some should refer these effects immediately unto God,
as many learned Authors have done; as though God by this
means would sometimes make known those that are guilty: or to
refer this unto the Devil, as though he would sometimes elude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the Judges, and to do this that so the innocent might be punished
with the wicked; We answer (he saith) to this briefly, by adding
this only, that a supernatural cause is not rashly to be feigned
where a natural one is ready at hand. And if there be such examples,
which cannot be reduced to these aforesaid natural causes,
of which sort many are related by <em>Libanius</em> <em>part</em> 2. <em>fol.</em> 172.
then we can by no reason be repugnant, but that they are preternaturally
brought to pass.” And of this opinion are most of the Pontificial
Writers, that thereby they might the better maintain their
Tenent, that miracles are not ceased; though we do not understand
that if we should grant, that in these things there should be some
concurrence of Divine Power more than ordinary, that therefore it
must be a miracle, for it is yet not infallibly concluded what a miracle
is, and every wonderful thing is not therefore concluded to
be a miracle, and a miracle being not absolutely defined, what is not
one cannot be certainly resolved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 6.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>6. Some there are that ascribe these strange bleedings of murthered
bodies, and of their strange motions, with the sweating of blood,
as upon the Pedlars bended dagger or knife, mentioned in the eleventh
History, unto the Astral or Sydereal spirit (and that not improbably;)
that being a middle substance, betwixt the Soul and the
Body doth, when separated from the Body, wander or hover near
about it, bearing with it the irascible and concupiscible faculties,
wherewith being stirred up to hatred and revenge, it causeth that
ebullition and motion in the blood, that exudation of blood upon
the weapon, and those other wonderful motions of the Body, Hands,
Nostrils and Lips, thereby to discover the murtherer, and bring
him to condign punishment. Neither is any Tenent yet brought by
any, that is more rationally probable to solve these and many other
wonderful Phenomena’s than this of the Astral Spirit, if it can be
but fully proved that there is such a part of Man that doth separately
exist, which we shall endeavour to prove ere we end this
Chapter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 7.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>7. But it is granted upon all sides, that if the murtherer be brought
to the presence, or touch of the person murthered, and not quite
dead, that then the wounds though closed and staid from bleeding,
or the nostrils, will freshly break forth and bleed plentifully. The
reason is obvious, because the Soul being yet in the Body, retaining
its power of sensation, fancy and understanding, will easily
have a presension of the murderer, and then no marvail that through
the vehement desire of revenge, the irascible and concupiscible faculties
do strongly move the blood, that before was beginning to
be stagnant, to motion and ebullition, and may exert so much force
upon the organs as for some small time to move the whole body,
the hands, or the lips and nostrils. So that all that is to be done,
is but to prove, that the person murthered is not absolutely dead,
and that the Soul is not totally separated or departed forth of the
Body, and this we shall do by undeniable proofs, as are these that follow
in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>1. Though we generally take death to be a perfect separation of
the Soul from the Body, which is most certainly a great truth, yet
when this is certainly brought to pass, is a most difficult point to
ascertain, because that when the Soul ceases to operate in the Body
so as to be perceived by our Senses, it will not follow, that therefore
the Soul is absolutely departed and separated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. Medic.</em> <em>p.</em> 617, 618.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. It is manifest that many persons through this mistake have in
the times of the Plague been buried quick, and so have some Women
been dealt withal that lay but in fits of the suffocation of the
Womb, and yet were taken to be dead. So that from the judgment
of our Senses, no certain conclusion can be made that the Soul is totally
departed, because it goeth away invisibly; for many that not
only to the judgment of the vulgar, but even in the opinion of
learned Physicians, have been accounted dead, yet have revived,
as learned <em>Schenckius</em> hath furnished us with this story from <em>Georgius
Pictorius</em>, “that a certain Woman lay in a fit of the Strangulation
of the Womb, for six continual days without sense or motion,
the arteries being grown hard, ready to be buried, and yet
revived again, and from <em>Paræus</em> of some that have lain three days
in Hysterical suffocations, and yet have recovered, and of divers
others that may be seen in the place quoted in the Margent.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. So that though the organs of the Body may by divers means,
either natural or violent, be rendered so unfit, that the Soul cannot
perform its accustomed functions in them, or by them, so as they
may be perceptible to our senses, or judgments; yet will not that
at all conclude, that the Soul is separated, and departed quite from
the Body, much less can we be able to define or set down the precise
time of the Souls aboad in the Body, nor the ultimate period
when it must depart, for the union may be (and doubtless is) more
strong in some than in others, and the Lamp of life far sooner and
more easily to be quenched in some than in others. And the Soul
may have a far greater amorosity to stay in some Body that is lively,
sweet, and young, than in others that are already decaying and beginning
to putrifie, and it may in all probability both have power
and desire to stay longer in that lovesome habitation, from whence
it is driven away by force, especially that it may satisfie it self in
discovering of the murderer, the most cruel and inhumane disjoyner
of that loving pair that God had divinely coupled together, and to
see it self, before its final departure, in a hopeful way to be revenged.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. If we physically consider the union of the Soul with the Body
by the mediation of the Spirit, then we cannot rationally conceive
that the Soul doth utterly forsake that union, untill by putrefaction,
tending to an absolute mutation, it be forced to bid farewel to
its beloved Tabernacle; for its not operating <i><span lang="la">ad extra</span></i> to our senses,
doth not necessarily inferr its total absence. And it may be
that there is more in that of <em>Abels blood crying unto the Lord</em>
from the ground, in a Physical sense, than is commonly conceived,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>and God may in his just judgment suffer the Soul to stay longer in
the murthered Body, that the cry of blood may make known the
murtherer, or may not so soon, for the same reason, call it totally away.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Explic. Astro.</em> <em>p.</em> 654.</div>

<p class='c008'>There is another kind of supposed Apparitions, that are believed
to be done in Beryls, and clear Crystals, and therefore called by
<em>Paracelsus</em> <em>Ars Beryllistica</em>, and which he also calls Nigromancy, because
it is practised in the dark by the inspection of a Boy or a Maid
that are Virgins, and this he strongly affirmeth to be natural and
lawful, and only brought to pass by the Sydereal influence, and
not at all Diabolical, nor stands in need of any Conjuration, Invocations
or Ceremonies, but is performed by a strong faith or imagination.
And of this he saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Sed ante omnia (ait) notate
proprietatem Beryllorum. Hisunt, in quibus spectantur præterita, præsentia,
&#38; futura. Quod nemini admirationi esse debet, ideò, quia
sydus influentiæ imaginem, &#38; similitudinem in Crystallum imprimit,
similem ei, de quo quæritur.</span></i> And a little after he saith: <i><span lang="la">Præterea
sideribus nota sunt omnia, quæ in natura existunt. Cumq;
Astra homini subjecta sint: potest is utiq; illa in subjectum ita cogere,
ut voluntati ejus ipsa obsecundent.</span></i> What truth there may be
in this his assertion, I have yet met with no reasons or experiments
that can give me satisfaction, and therefore I leave it to every
Man to censure as he pleaseth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>The only story that seems to carry any credit with it, touching
the truth of Apparitions in Crystals, is that which is related of that
great and learned Physician <em>Joachimus Camerarius</em> in his Preface
before <em>Plutarchs</em> Book <i><span lang="la">De Defectu Oraculorum</span></i>, from the mouth of
<em>Lassarus Spenglerus</em>, a person excellent both for Piety and Prudence,
and is, in effect this: “<em>Spengler</em> said, that there was one
person of a chief family in <em>Norimberge</em>, an honest and grave Man,
whom he thought not fit to name. That one time he came unto
him, and brought, wrapt in a piece of Silk, a Crystalline Gemm
of a round figure, and said that it was given unto him of a certain
stranger, whom many years before, having desired of him entertainment,
meeting him in the Market, he took home, and
kept him three days with him. And that this gift when he departed,
was left him as a sign of a grateful mind, having taught
such an use of the Crystal as this. If he desired to be made more
certain of any thing, that he should draw forth the glass, and will
a male chast Boy to look in it, and should ask of him what he
did see? For it should come to pass, that all things that he required,
should be shewed to the Boy, and seen in the Apparition.
And this Man did affirm, that he was never deceived in any one
thing, and that he had understood wonderful things by the boys
indication, when none of all the rest did by looking into it, see
it to be any thing else but a neat and pure Gemm. He tells a great
deal more of it, and that doubtful questions being asked, an answer
would appear to be read in the Crystal: but the Man being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>weary of the use of it, did give it to <em>Spengler</em>, who being a great
hater of superstition, did cause it to be broken into small pieces,
and so with the Silk in which it was wrapped, threw it into the
sink of the House.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I confess I have heard strange stories of things that have been revealed
by these supposed apparitions, from persons both of great
worth and learning; but seeking more narrowly into the matter I
found them all to be superstitious delusions, fancies, mistakes, cheats
and impostures. For the most part the child tells any thing that
comes into his fancy, or doth frame and invent things upon purpose,
that he never seeth at all, and the inquirers do presently assimilate
them to their own thoughts and suspicions. Some that pretended
to shew and foretel strange things thereby to get money, have been
discovered to have had confederates, that conveied away mens goods
into secret places, and gave the cunning Man notice where they
were hid, and then was the child taught a straight framed tale, to
describe what a like Man took them away, and where they were,
which being found brought credit enough to the couzeners, and
this I knew was practised by one <em>Brooke</em> and <em>Bolton</em>. Some have had
artificial glasses, whereinto they would convey little pictures, as
Dr. <em>Lambe</em> had.</p>

<p class='c008'>It being manifest by what we have laid down that there are apparitions
and some such other strange effects, whereby murthers are
often made known and discovered, and also having mentioned that it
may be most rationally probable that they are caused by the Astral
or Sydereal Spirit, it will be necessary to open and explain that
point, and to shew what grounds it hath, upon which it may be
settled, which we shall do in this order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Immort. of the Soul. <em>c.</em> 16. <em>sect.</em> 8. <em>p.</em> 296.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De verb. Apost.</span></i> <em>lib. Serm.</em> 18.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Idem contr. Pelag.</em></div>
<p class='c008'><em>c.</em> 28. <em>Tom.</em> 7.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. There are many (especially Popish Authors thereby to uphold
their Doctrine of Purgatory) that maintain that they are the
Souls of the persons murthered and deceased, and this opinion,
though unanswerably confuted by the whole company of reformed
Divines, is notwithstanding revived by Dr. <em>Henry Moore</em>, but
by no arguments either brought from Scripture, or grounded upon
any solid reasons, but only some weak conjectures, seeming absurdities,
and Platonick whimsies, which (indeed) merit no responsion.
And we have by positive and unwrested Scriptures, in
this Treatise afore proved, that the Souls of the righteous are in
<em>Abrahams</em> bosom with Christ at peace and rest, and that the Souls
of the wicked are in Hell in torments, so that neither of them do
wander here, or make any apparitions; for as S. <em>Augustine</em> taught
us: <i><span lang="la">Duo sunt habitacula, unum in igne æterno, alterum in regno
æterno</span></i>. And in another place: <i><span lang="la">Nec est ulli ullus medius locus, ut
possit esse nisi cum Diabolo, qui non est cum Christo</span></i>. And <em>Tertullian</em>
and <em>Justin Martyr</em>, two most ancient writers do tell us: “That
Souls being separated from their Bodies, do not stay or linger upon
the earth: And after they be descended into the infernal pit,
they do neither wander here upon their own accord, nor by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>power and command of others; But that wicked spirits may counterfeit
by craft that they are the Souls of the dead, <em>Vid. Lavaterum
de Spectris secunda parte</em> <em>c.</em> 5.”</p>

<p class='c008'>2. We have also shewed that these apparitions that discover
murther and murtherers and brings them to condign punishment,
cannot be the evil Angels, because they are only Ministers of torture,
sin, horror and punishment, but are not Authors of any good
either Corporeal or Spiritual, apparent or real. So that it must of
necessity be left either to be acted by a Divine Power, and that either
by the immediate power of the Almighty, for which we have
no proof, but only may acknowledge the possibility of it; or mediate
by the ministery of good Angels, which is hard to prove,
there being no one instance, or the least intimation of any such matter
in all the Scriptures, and therefore in most rational probability,
either relations of matters of fact of this nature are utterly false, or
they are effected by the Astral spirit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. lib. Sagac. Philos. passim.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Concerning the description of this Astral Spirit or Sydereal
Body, (for though it be as a spirit, or the image in the looking-glass,
yet it is truly corporeal) we shall give the sum of it, as <em>Paracelsus</em>
in his magisterial way, without proof doth lay down. “He positively
holdeth that there are three essential parts in Man, which
he calleth the three great substances, and that at death every one
of these being separated, doth return into, or unto the Womb
from whence it came; as The Soul that was breathed in by God,
doth at death return unto God that gave it: And that the Body,
that is to say, that gross part that seems to be composed of the two
inferior Elements of Earth and Water, doth return unto the Earth,
and there in time consume away, some bodies in a longer time,
some in a shorter: But the third part which he calleth the Astral
Spirit, or Sydereal Body, as being firmamental, and consisting of
the two superior Elements of Air and Fire, it (he saith) returneth
into its Sepulcher of the Air, where in time it is also consumed,
but requireth a longer time than the body, in regard it consisteth
of more pure Elements than the other, and that one of these Astral
Spirits or Bodies doth consume sooner than another, as they
are more impure, or pure. And that it is this spirit that carrieth along
with it the thoughts, cogitations, desires and imaginations
that were impressed upon the mind at the time of death, with the
sensitive faculties of concupiscibility and irascibility. And that
it is this spirit or body (and not the Soul that resteth in the hands of
the Lord) that appeareth, and is most usually conversant in those
places, and those negotiations that the mind of the person living
(whose spirit it was) did most earnestly follow, and especially
those things that at the very point of death, were most strongly
impressed upon this spirit, as in the case of the person murthered,
whose mind in the very minute of the murther, receiveth a most
deep impression of detestation and revenge against the murtherer,
which this spirit bearing with it, doth by all means possible seek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the accomplishment of that revenge, and therefore doth cause
dreams of discovery, bleedings and strange motions of the body
murthered, and sometimes plain apparitions of the persons murthered,
in their usual shape and habit, and doth vocally and audibly
reveal the murther with all the circumstances,” as is apparent
in the two forementioned Histories of the apparition of <em>Fletcher</em>
to <em>Raynard</em>, and of the Woman murthered by <em>Mark Sharp</em>, to the
Miller <em>Grimes</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Anim. Brut.</span></i> <em>c.</em> 1, 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. And this Astral Spirit is no more than that part in Man that is commonly
called the sensitive Soul, and by the Schools is commonly defined
thus: “<i><span lang="la">Anima sentiens est vis, quæ apprehendit &#38; percipit ea quæ extra
ipsam sunt</span></i>. And this is corporeal, and (as Dr. <em>Willis</em> holdeth)
mortal and coextended with the Body, and that it hath the power
of imagination, appetite, desire, and aversion and the like, and in a
manner, a sensitive way of ratiocination, and yet is distinct from the
rational Soul or <em>Mens</em> that is incorporeal, immortal, and far more excellent.”
And perspicacious <em>Helmont</em> holding this sensitive Soul to
be distinct from the <em>mens</em> or immortal and rational Soul, saith thus:
<i><span lang="la">Est ergo anima sensitiva, caduca, mortalis, mera lux vitalis data à
patre luminum, nec alio modo verboq; explicabilis</span></i>. But of the rational
Soul he saith: <i><span lang="la">Ipsa autem mens immortalis, est substantia lucida,
incorporea, immediate Dei sui imaginem referens, quia eandem
in creando, sive in ipso Empsychosis instanti, sibi insculptam suscepit</span></i>.
So that both these late and learned Authors hold, that in
every Man there are two distinct Souls, the sensitive that is mortal,
corporeal, and coextended with the Body, and the rational, that
is immortal and absolutely incorporeal: so that though in words
and terms they seem to differ, yet in substance they agree. For
the Hermetick School, the Platonists, <em>Paracelsus</em>, <em>Jacob Behemen</em>,
and others do hold three parts in Man which they call, Soul, Spirit
and Body, and these two last Authors do hold the body to be
one part in Man, and two Souls besides, the sensitive and rational
that are two distinct parts, the one corporeal and mortal, and the
other incorporeal and immortal, and so they do but nominally
differ. And now our task must be to prove, that first there are
such three parts in Man, and that after death they do separately exist,
which we shall attempt in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Though arguments taken <i><span lang="la">à notatione nominis</span></i>, do not necessarily
prove, yet they illustrate, and render the case plain and intelligible;
and we shall find that the <em>Hebrews</em> have three distinct appellations
for these three parts. As for the Soul, either rational or
sensitive, or vital spirit, they use <em>Nephesh</em> which is common to brutes
and reptiles as well as to Man, as saith the Text: <em>And to every beast
of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that
creepeth upon the earth in which there is a living soul, Nephesh-Haiah</em>.
And therefore to distinguish the rational and immortal Soul, from
this which is sensitive, mortal and common with brutes, the Text
saith: <em>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the earth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living
soul</em>. Upon which <i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> gives us this note: <i><span lang="la">Ut clarius
appareret discrimen quod est inter animam hominis, &#38; reliquorum
animantium: Horum enim animæ ex eadem materia provenerunt,
unde corpora habebant, illius verò anima spiritale quiddam est &#38;
Divinum</span></i>. And upon the words; <i><span lang="la">Sic fuit homo. Id est (ait) hac
ratione factum est, ut terrea illa statua animata viveret</span></i>. Another
word they use, which is <em>Ruah</em>, and this is also generally attributed
to Men and Beasts, as the words of <em>Solomon</em> do witness. <em>Who
knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upwards, and the spirit of the
beast that goeth downward to the earth?</em> And in both these, touching
both Man and Beast, the word <em>Ruah</em> is used as common to them
both; and sometimes it is taken specially for the rational immortal
Soul, as, <em>And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it</em>. Also
they have the word <em>Niblah</em>, and <i><span lang="es">Basar</span></i>, that is, <em>corpus</em>, <i><span lang="it">caro</span></i>, or
<em>cadaver</em>, and by these three they set forth, or distinguish these
three parts. And the Grecians have likewise their three several
names for these parts, as <span lang="grc">ψυχὴ</span>, <em>anima</em>, <i><span lang="it">vita</span></i>, which is taken promiscuously
sometimes for the rational and immortal Soul, as in this
place; <em>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul
and body in hell</em>. And it is taken for the life in that of the <em>Acts</em>:
<em>And Paul said, Trouble not your selves, his life is in him</em>. Also they
have the word <span lang="grc">Πνεῦμα</span>, <i><span lang="la">Spiritus, ventus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">spiritus vitæ</span></i>, being variously
taken, yet sometimes for the rational and immortal Soul,
as <em>Father into thy hands I commend my spirit</em>. So they have the
word <span lang="grc">Σῶμα</span>, <em>Corpus</em>, the body or gross and fleshly part. And to
these accord the three Latine terms for these three distinct parts;
<em>Anima</em>, <i><span lang="la">Spiritus</span></i> and <em>Corpus</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. This opinion of these three parts in Man, to wit Body, Soul
and Spirit, is neither new, nor wants Authors of sufficient credit
and learning to be its Patrons. For <em>Hermes Trismegistus</em> an Author
almost of the greatest Antiquity saith thus: <span lang="grc">καὶ ὁ μὲν Θεὸς ἐν τῷ νῷ, ὁ δὲ νοῦς
ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ, ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ ἐν τῇ ὕλη</span>. That is, <em>God is in the mind, the mind in
the soul, and the soul in matter</em>. But <em>Marsilius Ficinus</em> gives it
thus: <i><span lang="la">Beatus Deus, Dæmon bonus, animam esse in corpore, mentem
in anima, in mente verbum pronunciavit</span></i>. And further addeth:
<i><span lang="la">Deus verò circa omnia, simul atq; per omnia, mens circa animam,
anima circa aërem, aër circa materiam</span></i>. And some give it more
fully thus. <em>God is in the mind, the mind in the Soul, the Soul in
the Spirit, the Spirit in the blood, and the blood in the Body.</em> But
besides this ancient testimony, it is apparent that the whole School
of the Platonists, both the elder and later were of this opinion, and
also the most of the Cabalists: For <em>Ficinus</em> from the Doctrine
of <em>Plato</em> tells us this: <i><span lang="la">Humanæ cogitationis domicilium anima ipsa
est. Animæ domicilium spiritus. Domicilium spiritus hujus est
corpus.</span></i> But omitting multitudes of others that are strong Champions
for this Tenent, we think for authorities to acquiesce in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>of our most learned Physician and Anatomist Dr. <em>Willis</em>, and in
those that he hath quoted, which we shall give in the English:
First he saith: “Lest I be tedious in rehearsing many, it pleaseth
me here only to cite two Authors (but either of which is a Troop)
for the confutation of the contrary opinion. The one (he saith)
is the most famous Philosopher <em>Petrus Gassendus</em>, who <em>Physic. Sect.</em>
3. <em>lib.</em> 9. <em>c.</em> 11. doth divide, <em>toto Cœlo</em>, (as is said) the mind of
man, from the other sensitive power, as much as is possible to be
done, by many and most signal notes of discrimination, yea disjoining
of them (as it is said in the Schools) by specific differences:
Because when he had shewed this to be corporeal, extended,
nascible and corruptible, he saith the other is an incorporeal substance,
and therefore immortal, which is immediately created,
and infused into the body by God; to which opinion he sheweth
<em>Pythagoras</em>, <em>Plato</em>, <em>Aristotle</em>, and for the most part all the ancient
Philosophers, except <em>Epicurus</em>, did much agree; excepting notwithstanding
that they did hold, as not knowing the origin of
the Soul, which they judged to be immortal, that it being cropt
off from the soul of the world, did slide into the body, and that it
was poured again into the Soul of the world either immediately, or
at the last mediately, after its transmigration into other bodies.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>p.</em> 74.</div>

<p class='c008'>The other suffrage (he saith) upon this matter, is of the most
learned Divine Dr. <em>Hamond</em>, our Countryman, who opening the
Text <em>Epist. Thessalo.</em> 1. <em>c.</em> 5. <em>v.</em> 23. to wit, <em>your whole spirit and
soul and body &#38;c.</em> “He saith that Man is divided into three parts.
1. To wit, into the body, by which is denoted the flesh and the
members. 2. Into the vital soul, which in like manner being animal
and sensitive is common to man with the bruits. 3. Into the
spirit, by which the rational soul, that was first created of God,
is signified, which also being immortal doth return unto God.
<em>Annot. in Nov. Testam.</em> <em>lib. p.</em> 711.” This his exposition he confirmeth
by Testimonies brought from Ethnick Authors, and also
from the ancient Fathers. From all which the learned Dr. doth
make this conclusion: “And from the things above (he saith) it is
most evidently manifest, that man being as it were an Amphibious
animal, or of a middle nature and order betwixt the Angels and
bruits, with these he doth communicate by a corporeal soul, framed
of the vital blood and the stock of animal spirit, joyned
likewise in one; and with the other he communicates by an intelligent
soul immaterial and immortal.” And thus much for arguments
brought from humane authority, which are prevalent,
if they be brought affirmatively (as these are) from learned men
or Artificers, and so we shall proceed to further kind of proofs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1 Thes. 5. 23.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Ephes. 4. 17.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. But an argument arising from Divine Authority is of the most
force of all, and therefore let us a little survey the Text it self,
which in our English Translation is thus: <em>And the very God of
peace sanctifie you wholly: And I pray God your whole Spirit, and
Soul, and Body be preserved blameless, unto the coming of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Lord Jesus Christ</em>. The Apostle having given the believing <em>Thessalonians</em>
all the spiritual counsel that could be necessary, to bring
them to the perfection of sanctification, doth pray for them, that
the God of peace would sanctifie them wholly, or as the word
<span lang="grc">ὁλοτελοῖς</span> signifieth (as <em>Arias Montanus</em> hath rendered it) <em>omninòperfectos</em>,
altogether perfect, And that the whole, <span lang="grc">ὁλόκληρον</span>, that is the
whole part, portion or lot (for so the word properly signifieth)
which he nameth by <em>Spirit, Soul and Body, to be preserved blameless,
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</em>. And therefore to
this doth learned <em>Beza</em> add this note: “<i><span lang="la">Tum demùm igitur (ait)
homo integer sanctificatus fuerit, quum nihil cogitabit spiritus,
nihil appetet anima, nihil exequetur corpus, quod cum Dei voluntate
non consentiat</span></i>.” And before he had said: “Therefore <em>Paul</em> by
the appellation of spirit doth signifie the mind, in which the
principal stain lieth: and by the Soul the rest of the inferior faculties,
and by the body the domicile of the Soul.” And in another
place he saith: “The mind is become vain, the cogitation obscured,
the appetite hardened.” And to the same purpose doth
learned <em>Rollock</em> upon the place say thus much: “Sanctification, or
transformation is not of any one part, but of all the parts, and of
the whole man. For there is no part or particle in man, which
was not deformed in that first fall, and made as it were monstrous.
Therefore <span lang="grc">μεταμόρφωσις</span>, or transformation ought to be of the whole
man and of every singular part of him. And further he saith: For
the whole man the Apostle hath here the enumeration of his principal
parts. And they are three in number, Spirit, Soul and Body.
By the spirit (he saith) I understand the mind, which the Apostle
<em>Eph.</em> 4. 24. calleth <em>the spirit of the mind</em>, and this is no other
thing than the faculty of the rational mind, which is discerned
in invention, and in judging of things found out. By the name
of soul (he saith) I understand all those inferior faculties of the
mind, as are the animal which are also called natural. The body
doth follow these parts, to wit that gross part which is the instrument
by which the spirit and soul do exert their functions and
operations.” By all which it is most clear, that though they
call them faculties, yet they are distinct essential parts of the whole
man, which is most manifest, in that the body, though one of these
three, cannot be a faculty, but a meer instrument, and yet is one
of the essential parts, that doth integrate the whole man. But
whosoever shall seriously consider, how little satisfaction the definition
of a faculty given by either Philosophers or Physicians, will
bring to a clear understanding, may easily perceive, that distinct
parts are commonly taken to be faculties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ut supra</span></i> <em>c.</em> 7. <em>p.</em> 74.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. The first argument that this learned Physician urgeth, to prove
that there are two Souls in man, the one sensitive and corporeal,
the other rational, immortal and incorporeal, is in this order. “But
(he saith) whereas it is said that the rational soul doth by it self
exercise every of the animal faculties, it is most of all improbable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>because the actions and passions of all the animal senses and motions
are corporeal, divided and extended to various parts, to perform
which immediately the incorporeal and indivisible soul (if
so be it be finite) seemeth unfit or unable. Further (he saith)
what belongeth unto that vulgar opinion, that the sensitive soul
is subordinate to the rational, and as it were swallowed up of it,
that that which is the soul in brutes, in man becomes a meer power;
these are the trifles of the Schools. For how should the sensitive
soul of man, which before hath been in act a subsistent, material
and extended substance, losing its essence, at the advent of
the rational soul, degenerate into a meer qualitie? But if it be
asserted that the rational soul, by its advent also doth introduce
life and sensation, then man doth not generate an animated man,
but only a formless body, or a rude heap of flesh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Another argument he useth to prove these two souls in man
is this: “Therefore (he saith) it being supposed that the rational
soul doth come to the body before animated of the other corporeal
soul, we may inquire, by what band or tye, seeing it is a pure
spirit, can it be united to this, seeing it hath not parts, by which
it might be tied, or adhere to the whole or any of the parts? And
therefore he thinketh that concerning this point it is to be said
with most learned <em>Gassendus</em>: That the corporeal soul is the immediate
subject of the rational soul, of which seeing it is the act,
perfection, complement and form, also by it the rational soul is
made or becometh the form and act of the humane body. But
seeing that it doth scarce seem like or necessary, that the whole
corporeal soul should be possessed of the whole rational soul;
Therefore it is lawful to determine that this rational soul, being
purely spiritual, should reside as in its Throne, in the principal
part or faculty of it, to wit in the imagination, framed of a small
portion of the animal spirits, being most subtile, and seated in the
very middle or center of the brain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Another chief argument that he useth to prove these two
souls in man, is the strife and disagreements that are within man:
“Because (he saith) the intellect and imagination are not wont to
agree in so many things, but that also the sensitive appetite doth
dissent in more things: From whose litigations moreover it shall
be lawful to argue, that the moodes of the aforesaid souls, both
in respect of subsisting and operating, are distinct. For as there is
in man a double cognitive power, to wit the intellect and imagination,
so there is a double appetite, the Will proceeding from
the Intellect, which is the Page or servant of the rational soul,
and the sensitive Appetite, which cohering to the imagination,
is said to be the hands, or procuratrix of the corporeal soul.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ephes. 4. 18.</div>

<p class='c008'>7. To these we shall add, that when the understanding is truly
enlightened with the spirit of God, and led by the true light of the
Gospel, in the ways of Christ, then is man said to be spiritual, because
the carnal mind and the sensitive appetite are subdued and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>brought under to the obedience of Christ by his grace. So also when
the understanding is darkned, as saith the Apostle; <em>Having the understanding
darkened, being alienated from the life of God thorow
the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts</em>.
Then man becomes wholly led with the carnal and sensual appetite,
and is therefore called <span lang="grc">ψυχικὸς ἄνθρωπος</span>, the natural, animal or
soully man: And in both these conditions the organical body is
led and acted according to the ruling power, either of the Spirit
of God, and so it is yielded up a living sacrifice to God, or of the
spirit of darkness, corruption, and the sensitive appetite, and so is an
instrument of all unrighteousness. By all which it is most manifest
that there are in man these three parts, of Body, Soul, and Spirit,
which was the thing undertaken to be proved.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Lastly as to this point, it is a certain truth that two extreams
cannot be joined or coupled together, but by some middle thing
that participated or cometh near to the nature of both. So the
Soul which (by the unanimous consent of all men) is a spiritual
and pure, immaterial and incorporeal substance cannot be united to
the body, which is a most gross, thick and corporeal substance,
without the intervention of some middle nature, fit to conjoin and
unite those extreams together, which is this sensitive and corporeal
Soul or Astral Spirit, which in respect of the one extream incorporeal,
yet of the most pure sort of bodies that are in nature, and
that which approacheth most near to a spiritual and immaterial
substance, and therefore most fit to be the immediate receptacle of
the incorporeal Soul: And also it being truly body doth easily
join with the gross body, as indeed being congenerate with it, and
so becomes <i><span lang="la">vinculum &#38; nexus</span></i> of the immaterial Soul and the more
gross body, that without it could not be united.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now having (as we conceive) sufficiently proved that there are
in man these three distinct parts of Body, Soul, and Spirit, in the next
place we are to shew that these three may, and do separately exist,
and that we shall endeavour by these reasons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Eccl. 12. 7.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>2 Cor. 5. 1.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. It is manifest by Divine Authority that <em>the spirit</em>, that is the
rational, immortal and incorporeal <em>soul</em>, <em>doth return to God that
gave it</em>. That is not to be annihilated or to vanish into nothing,
but to abide and remain forever or eviternally. For the Apostle
saith: <em>For we know, that if our earthly tabernacle or house were
dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens</em>. By which it is manifest that the immaterial
Soul doth exist eternally <i><span lang="la">ex parte post</span></i>, as the Schools say, and also
the gross body being separated from the immortal Soul, doth by
it self exist until it be consumed in the grave, or by corruption be
changed into earth, or some other things, or that the Atomes be
dispersed, and joined unto, or figurated into some other bodies.
So it is most highly rational that this sensitive Soul, or Astral Spirit,
which is corporeal, should also exist by it self for some time,
until it be dissipated and wasted, in which time it may (and doubtlesly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>doth) make these apparitions, motions and bleedings of the
murthered bodies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Reas. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Upon the supposition that the rational Soul be not <i><span lang="la">ex traduce</span></i>,
but be infused after the bodily organs be fitted and prepared,
which is the firm Tenent of all Divines Ancient, middle and Modern,
and must upon the granting of it to be simply, and absolutely
immaterial and incorporeal (which is indisputable) of necessity
be infused, because no immaterial substance can be produced or
generated by the motion of any agent, that is meerly material, or
forth of any material substance whatsoever. And therefore I say
that the Soul being infused, it must of necessity follow the organized
body, that could not exist (except as a lump of flesh) without the
corporeal sensitive soul; which must of necessity demonstrate, that
as they did separately exist before the union of the Soul and Body,
so they also do exist distinctly after their separation by death,
and so the Astral Spirit may effect the things we have asserted.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. And if the experiment be certainly true that is averred by <em>Borellus</em>,
<em>Kircher</em>, <em>Gaffarel</em>, and others (who might be ashamed to affirm
it as their own trial, or as ocular witnesses, if not true) that
the figures and colours of a plant may be perfectly represented, and
seen in glasses, being by a little heat raised forth of the ashes. Then
(if this be true) it is not only possible, but rational, that animals
as well as plants, have their Ideas or Figures existing after the
gross body or parts be destroyed, and so these apparitions are but
only those Astral shapes and figures. But also there are shapes and
apparitions of Men, that must of necessity prove that these corporeal
Souls or Astral Spirits do exist apart, and attend upon or are
near the blood, or bodies; of which <em>Borellus</em> Physician to the King
of <em>France</em>, gives us these two relations.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Our Countryman Dr. <em>Flud</em> a person of much learning and
great sincerity, doth tell us this well attested story: “That a certain
Chymical Operator, by name <em>La Pierre</em>, near that place in <em>Paris</em>
called <em>Le Temple</em>, received blood from the hands of a certain
Bishop to operate upon. Which he setting to work upon the <em>Saturday</em>,
did continue it for a week with divers degrees of fire,
and that about midnight the <em>Friday</em> following, this Artificer lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>in a Chamber next to his Laboratory, betwixt sleeping and
waking, heard an horrible noise, like unto the lowing of Kine,
or the roaring of a Lion; and continuing quiet, after the ceasing
of the sound in the Laboratory, the Moon being at the full by
shining enlightening the Chamber, suddenly betwixt himself and
the Window he saw a thick little cloud, condensed into an oval
form, which after by little and little did seem compleatly to put
on the shape of a Man, and making another and a sharp clamour,
did suddenly vanish. And that not only some Noble Persons in
the next Chambers, but also the Host with his Wife, lying in a
lower room of the house, and also the neighbors dwelling in the
opposite side of the street, did distinctly hear as well the bellowing
as the voice, and some of them were awaked with the vehemency
thereof. But the Artificer said that in this he found solace,
because the Bishop of whom he had it, did admonish him,
that if any of them from whom the blood was extracted, should
die in the time of its putrefaction, his Spirit was wont often to appear
to the sight of the Artificer, with perturbation. Also forthwith
upon <em>Saturday</em> following he took the retort from the Furnace
and broke it with the light stroak of a little key, and there
in the remaining blood found the perfect representation of an humane
head, agreeable in face, eyes, nostrils, mouth and hairs,
that were somewhat thin and of a golden colour. And of this last
there were many ocular witnesses, as the Noble person Lord of
<em>Bourdalone</em>, the Chief Secretary to the Duke of <em>Guise</em>, and that
he had this relation from the Lord of <em>Menanton</em> living in that house
at the same time, from a certain Doctor of Physick, from the owner
of the house, and many others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So that it is most evident that there are not only three essential,
and distinct parts in Man, as the gross body, consisting of Earth and
Water, which at death returns to the earth again, the sensitive and corporeal
Soul, or Astral Spirit, consisting of Fire and Air, that at
death wandereth in the air, or near the body, and the immortal
and incorporeal Soul that immediately returns to God that gave
it: But also that after death they all three exist separately; the Soul
in immortality, and the body in the earth, though soon consuming;
and the Astral spirit that wanders in the air, and without doubt
doth make these strange apparitions, motions, and bleedings; and so
we conclude this tedious discourse with the Chapter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAP. XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'><em>Of the force and efficacy of Words or Charms, whether they
effect any thing at all or not, and if they do, whether it be
by Natural or Diabolical virtue and force.</em></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>There is nothing almost so common not only in the Poets (who
have been the chief disseminators of many such things) but
in most of other Authors, as the mention of the force of Charms
and Incantations: And yet if we narrowly search into the bottom
of the matter, there is nothing more difficult than to find out any
truth of the effects of them, in matters of fact; and therefore that
we may more clearly manifest what we have proposed in this Chapter,
we shall first premise these few things.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Those that take the effects of them to be great, as many Divines,
Philosophers, and Physicians do, suppose no efficacy in them
solely, holding that <i><span lang="la">quantitates rerum nullius sunt efficaciæ</span></i>, but
that they are only signs from the Devil to delude the minds of
those that use them, and in the mean time that the Devil doth produce
the effects. But it had been well, if those that are of this opinion,
had shewed us the ways and means how the Devil doth operate
such things, seeing he can do nothing in corporeal matter but
by natural means: So that either we must confess that there is no
force at all in Charms, or that the effects produced are by natural
means.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Syl. Syl.</em> <em>Cent.</em> 10. <em>p.</em> 583.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Neither can we assent fully to those that hold, that the force
of imagination can work strange things upon other bodies, distinct
and separate from the body imaginant, upon which it is not denied
to have power to operate very wonderful things; and that for the
reason given by the most learned Lord <em>Verulam</em>, which is this: <i><span lang="la">Experimenta
quæ vim imaginationis in corpora aliena solidè probent,
pauca aut nulla prorsus sunt; cum fascini exempla huc non faciant,
quod Dæmonum interventu fortasse non careant</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>p.</em> 554.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="it">Medicina Magnetica</span></i>, <em>p.</em> 14, 17, 19.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. I said <em>not assent fully</em>, because there are some reasons that incline
me to believe the possibility of it, though there be hardly
found any experiments that solidly prove it. For as the said Lord
Verulam saith again: <i><span lang="la">Movendi sunt homines, ne fidem detrahant
operationibus ex transmissione spirituum, &#38; vi imaginationis, quia
eventus quandoq; fallit</span></i>. And there are so many learned Authors
(though Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> according to his scurrilous manner stiles
them Enthusiastical <em>Arabs</em>) of all sorts, that do stifly maintain the
power of the imagination upon extraneous bodies, with such
strength of argument, that I much stagger concerning the point,
and therefore dare not say my assent is fully to either. For learned
Dr. <em>Willis</em> having (as we conceive) unanswerably proved that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>is a twofold Soul in Man, and that the one which is the sensitive,
is corporeal, though much approaching to the nature of spirit, how
far the force of imagination, which is its instrument, may reach, or
what it may work at distance, is not easy to determine. And if the
Soul, as <em>Helmont</em> laboureth to prove, by the Prerogative of its
creation can when suscitated by strong desire and exalted phantasie
operate <i><span lang="la">per nutum</span></i>, then it must needs follow, that it may work upon
other bodies than its own, and so using Words, Charms, Characters
and Images may bring to pass strange things. But if these
three conclusions be certain and true, written by the pen of a most
learned, though less vulgarly known Author, to wit: “1. The
Soul is not only in its proper visible body, but also without it;
neither is it circumscribed in an organical body. 2. The Soul
worketh without, or beyond its proper body commonly so called.
3. From every body flow corporeal beams, by which the
Soul worketh by its presence, and giveth them energie and power
of working: And these beams are not only corporeal, but of
divers parts also:” If these (I say) be certain, then doth the imagination
work at distance by means of those beams, and consequently
Words and Charms, and such like may be the means and instruments,
by which the imagination (being the principal power of the
sensitive Soul) may operate strange things at distance, and so that
not be vain which learned <em>Agrippa</em> tells us.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la">Nos habitat, non Tartara, sed nec sydera Cœli:</span></i></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i><span lang="la">Spiritus in nobis qui viget, illa facit.</span></i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>And we have before sufficiently proved, that the species of bodies
are corporeal, and it is plain, that these operate upon our eyes at a
vast distance, and do intersect one another in the air without confusion.
And we must in all reason acknowledge that the sensitive
Soul, must needs be of as much purity, and energie as those that
we call the sensible, or visible species of things, and then it must
necessarily follow, that it by the means of the imagination may operate
at a great distance, and so words and charms may from thence
have power and operation. For learned <em>Agrippa</em> that great Philosopher,
and master of lawful and natural Magick and not of that
which is accounted diabolical (as the wretched pen of <em>Paulus Jovius</em>
hath painted him) holds this: <i><span lang="la">Quod unicuiq; homini impressus est
Character Divinus, cujus vigore potest pertingere ad operandum mirabilia</span></i>.
Which if so, then many words, charms and the like, have
a natural efficacy to work wonderful things, and that at a great distance
also.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vt supra</em> <em>p.</em> 555, 556.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. I cannot likewise but take notice of another caution, very
pertinent to our present purpose, given us also by the said Lord <em>Verulam</em>,
and in English is this: “Again men are to be holden back
from the peril of credulity, lest here they too much rashly incline
with an easy faith, because they often see the event to answer to
the operations. For the cause of the success is to be referred often
to the forces of the affections and imaginations in the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>that is the agent, which by a certain secondary reason may act in a
diverse body. As for example: If any one carry about the figure
of a Planet or a Ring or a part of some beast, being certainly perswaded,
that it will prove helpful unto him in promoting his love,
or that he may be preserved from danger or wound in battel, or
in strife that he may overcome &#38;c. it may render his wit more
stirring, or may add spurs to his industry, or may cherish confidence
and hold up constancie, from which perchancie he might
have slided. Now who is ignorant what industry and a mind tenacious
of its purpose, may design and bring to pass in civil affairs?
Therefore (he concludeth) he should err and deceive and
be deceived, who should ascribe these things to the force of imagination
upon the body of another, which his own imagination
worketh in his own body.” And therefore this may caution all
that would judge aright of the force and effects of words and
charms that they may perhaps neither flow from the nature or efficacy
of the words, nor from the force of the imagination of him
or her that pronounceth, writeth, giveth or applieth the charm,
but from the imagination and belief of the person to whom they
are applied, and for whom they are intended. For it is manifest
by common experience (and we our selves have known it to be
certain) that these charms either pronounced, or written and hung
about the patients neck, have produced the greatest effects, upon
such as are of the weakest judgment and reason, as Women, Children,
and ignorant and superstitious persons, who have great confidence
in such vain and inefficacious trifles; and that they seldom
or never produce any effects at all, upon such as are obstinate Infidels
in the belief of their operations, and I fear we shall not (or
very hardly) find any instance to make this good, that they effectively
work upon such as are utterly diffident of their force or
power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Cent. Problem.</em> <em>Decad.</em> 2. <em>p.</em> 38.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. It hath sometimes been a question, Whether a rational Physician
in the curing of melancholy persons, or others in some odd
diseases, ought to grant the use of Characters or Charms, and such
ridiculous administrations? Which is decided in the affirmative,
that it is lawful and necessary to use them, by that able and learned
Physician <em>Gregorius Horstius</em>, by eight strong and convincing
arguments. And we our selves having practised the art of medicine
in all its parts in the North of <em>England</em>, where Ignorance, Popery,
and superstition doth much abound, and where for the most part
the common people, if they chance to have any sort of the Epilepsie,
Palsie, Convulsions or the like, do presently perswade themselves
that they are bewitched, fore-spoken, blasted, fairy-taken,
or haunted with some evil spirit, and the like; and if you should
by plain reasons shew them, that they are deceived, and that there
is no such matter, but that it is a natural disease, say what you can
they shall not believe you, but account you a Physician of small or
no value, and whatsoever you do to them, it shall hardly do them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>any good at all, because of the fixedness of their depraved and prepossessed
imagination. But if you indulge their fancy, and seem
to concur in opinion with them, and hang any insignificant thing
about their necks, assuring them that it is a most efficacious and
powerful charm, you may then easily settle their imaginations, and
then give them that which is proper to eradicate the cause of their
disease, and so you may cure them, as we have done great numbers.
Here it is most manifest that the charm or appension hath no efficacy
at all, and yet accidentally, it conduces to settle their fancies
and confidences, which conduceth much to their cures. And
from hence it comes to pass that by reason of the fixed belief of
the party to whom the charm is applied, there are many helped,
when the causality and efficiency is solely in the person imaginant
and confident of receiving help by the means of the charm, and no
efficacy at all in the charm it self, nor no diabolical concurrence,
besides what obliquity may be in the minds of the actors, nor no
agency in the imagination of the charmer, to produce the effect: yet
because often people are cured thereby, the common people (and
sometimes the learned also) do attribute the whole effect unto the
charm, when indeed it effecteth nothing at all. And to this purpose
<em>Varius</em> doth quote a passage from Galen, which is this: <i><span lang="la">Sunt
quidam natura læti, qui quando ægrotant, si eos sanos futuros medicus
confirmet, convalescunt; quorum spes sanitatis est causa: &#38;
medicus si animi desiderium incantatione, aut alicujus rei ad collum
appensione adjuverit, citius ad valetudinem perducet</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>But we now come to examine if we can find any convincing examples,
from Authors of credit, that in words, characters and
charms there is any force or efficacy; and this we shall endeavour
from the best and most punctual Authors, that have come within
the compass of our knowledge, or reading, and that in this order,
to which we shall add some observations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De abdit. rer. caus.</span></i> <em>l.</em> 1. <em>c.</em> 11. <em>p.</em> 65.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. I think there are few that have been, or are Students or Practitioners
in the Art of Medicine, that have not either heard, or
read the writing of that most able and learned person <em>Johannes
Fernelius</em> who was Physician to the most Christian King of <em>France</em>
<em>Henry</em> the second, who in that most profound piece that he writ,
<i><span lang="la">De abditis rerum causis</span></i>, gives us as an ocular witness this relation.
“I have (he saith) seen a certain Man, who by the virtue or force
of words did brings various Specters, or Apparitions into a looking-glass,
which did there so clearly express forthwith either in
writing or in true images, whatsoever he commanded, that all
things were readily and easily known to those that were by.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. From hence we may observe, that <em>Fernelius</em> seeing this (as he
saith) with his eyes, cannot (being so great a Scholar, and a circumspect
person) be imagined to have been deceived, or imposed
upon; though as much as he relates might have been brought to
pass by the artificial placing of the glass, and having several images
and things written moved by a confederate placed in some secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>corner, where the images might fitly be reflected from the glass to the
sight of the by-standers, or by some other means performed by the optical
science and confederacy. And it is no sure ground to introduce
a Demon to act the business, when artificial means may rationally
solve the matter, neither was it impossible but he might mistake in
the conjecture of the cause of those Phenomena.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. And though he seems by his preceeding discourse, to believe it
to have been caused but by a league and compact betwixt the person
that shewed it, and some Cacodæmon: yet he bringeth no
better proof for it, than the rotten authority of <em>Porphyrius</em> and
<em>Proclus</em>, and no convincing argument that Demons can perform
any such strange matters. And however if they were the meer apparitions
of evil spirits, it is much to be wondered that <em>Fernelius</em>
would be present at any such sinful and dangerous sights, or have such
familiar conversation with any of that damned crew, seeing he
there saith: <i><span lang="la">Quæ omnes prorsus vanæ &#38; captiosæ sunt artes</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. If these Apparitions were caused by Cacodæmons, then there
was no efficacy in the words at all, they were nothing but the sign
of the league betwixt the evil spirit, and the person that represented
them; and then he need not have said, that they were derived
into the glass <i><span lang="la">vi verborum</span></i>, and so this will not prove that it was
effected by force of the words. But if all this that he relates, did
proceed but from lawful and natural causes, as <em>Paracelsus</em> strongly
holds (the glass being but made as that which he saw in <em>Spain</em>, of
the <i><span lang="la">Electrum</span></i> that he mentions) then the words might be efficacious,
and so it is a punctual instance to prove that words are operative,
which is the thing <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, that we here seek after.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The next History to this purpose we shall take from <i><span lang="la">Antonius
Benevenius</span></i>, as we find him quoted by that learned person <em>Marcellus
Donatus</em>, and likewise Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> (for I have not the book
by me) who renders it thus. “A Souldier had an arrow shot
through the left part of his breast, so that the iron of it stuck to
the very bone of the right shoulder. Great endeavours were used
to get it out, but to no purpose. <em>Benevenius</em> doth shew, that
it was not feasible without present death. The Man seeing himself
forsaken by Physicians and Chirurgeons, sends for a noted
<em>Ariolus</em> or Conjurer: who setting his two fingers upon the wound,
with some Charms he used, commanded the iron to come out,
which presently without any pain of the patient, came forth, and
the Man was presently healed: And this the Doctor, who I presume
had the book, saith, that <em>Benevenius</em> saith <i><span lang="la">vidimus</span></i> we have
seen it, which <em>Marcellus Donatus</em> saith, the Author ascribed
to the virtue of the words, and others to the force of imagination.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. Here we may observe, that this may either be brought to pass
by the efficacy of the words or charms that he muttered, and then
we must needs confess that charms are of great and stupendious
force: or that it might be effected by the imagination of the Charmer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>and then we must suppose (which the most do deny) that the imagination
of the person imaginant, hath power to operate upon extraneous
bodies, if it had power to cause the iron to come without
harm forth of the wounded Souldiers body, or it may be caused
(and that in most probability) by the imagination of the party
wounded being excited and roused up by the uttering of the charm,
in which the patient (in all likelihood) had no small confidence.
And so however the charm was an accidental cause, or (as they use
to say) <i><span lang="la">causa sine qua non</span></i>, of the bringing forth of the iron.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 3.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Lection. in Fen. 2. Avicen.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Another History we must borrow from the aforesaid two Authors
<i><span lang="la">Donatus</span></i> and Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>, which they have transcribed forth
of <em>Johannes Baptista Montanus</em>, because I have not the Author by
me, and is this: “My self with mine eyes, you may (he saith) believe
me, have seen it: A certain man who when he had made a
circle and drawn some characters about it, and uttered some words,
he did call together above a hundred Serpents. And further saith,
that though he did murmur certain words, yet he holdeth, that
the bringing of the Serpents together was not performed by the
force of the words, but by the power of a strong imagination,
and that some by the strength of imagination, not of words, are
said to draw forth darts, and to cure wounds.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Observ. 1.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>1. And here we may take notice that this is a punctual and positive
History, plainly declaring the matter of fact, in calling together
above an hundred Serpents, and this must be done either
by the force of the words, or by the strength of the persons imagination,
or both, unless we must admit the Devil to perform it,
which may vainly be supposed, but cannot be proved, by what natural
means he should bring it to pass. But however the relation
is very credible, <em>Montanus</em> being a famous Physician and Professor
at <em>Padua</em>, and affirms it as seen with his own eyes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Wier. de mag. Infant.</em> <em>p.</em> 92.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. To these we may add one of sufficient credit from the learned
<em>Masius</em>, as it is cited by <em>Wierus</em>, and Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> (which may be
we have related before, but not to this purpose) and is this: “I also
(he saith) have seen them who with words (or charms) could
stop wild beasts, and force them to await the stroak of the dart:
who also could force that Domestick beastly creature, which we
call a Rat, as soon as seen, amazed and astonished to stand still, as
it were immoveable, until not by any deceit or ambushes, but
only stretching their hands, they had taken them and strangled
them.” This is from his own sight, and he a Man of undoubted
veracity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. Another take from the credit of Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> who fathers it
upon <em>Remigius</em>, but confesseth that at the time of his writing the story
he could not find it in <em>Remigius</em> his Book, and is this. “I have seen
a Man (saith he) who from all the neighbourhood (or confines)
would draw Serpents into the fire, which was inclosed within a
magical circle; and when one of them, bigger than the rest,
would not be brought in, upon repetition of the charms before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>used, he was forced, and so into the fire he did yield himself with
the rest, and with it was compassed.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 6.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Antidot. against Atheism. <em>c.</em> 2. <em>p.</em> 166.</div>

<p class='c008'>6. To these we shall adjoin another story written from Wierus by
Dr. <em>Moore</em> thus: “And (he saith) <em>Wierus</em> tells us this story of a
Charmer at <em>Saltzburg</em>, that when in the sight of the people he
had charmed all the Serpents into a ditch and killed them, at
last there came one huge one far bigger than the rest, that leapt
upon him and winded about his waste like a girdle, and pulled
him into the ditch, and so killed the Charmer himself in the conclusion.”
And this great Serpent the Doctor taketh (in his Appendix)
to be a Devil, or a Serpent actuated and guided by him,
but upon what grounds of reason I can no way understand.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Archidox. Magic.</em> <em>l.</em> 1. <em>p.</em> 695.</div>

<p class='c008'>These are the most material passages that in our reading we
can find in credible and learned Authors, to prove thereby the effects
of charms <i><span lang="la">de facto</span></i>, and we confess they are all short, and not
sufficiently evidential, as such a case may justly require; and therefore
we shall here add some testimonies of good Authors that do
strongly affirm and aver the same. As not to stand upon the authorities
of the Cabalists, Platonists or Arabians, we find the truth
of the charming of Serpents avouched by <em>Paracelsus</em> (whose credit
in this point, may be equivalent to any others) who saith thus:
“But (he saith) answer me from whence is this, that a Serpent in
<em>Helvetia</em>, <em>Algovia</em>, or <em>Suevia</em>, doth understand the <em>Greek Idiom</em>,
<em>Osy, Osya, Osy, &#38;c.</em> When notwithstanding the Greek tongue is
not so common in this age, with the Helvetians, Algovians, or
Suevians, that the venenous worms should be able to learn it? Tell
me (he saith) how, where and from what causes, Serpents do understand
these words, or in what Academies have they learned
them, that they should forthwith at the first hearing of those
words, stop their ears, with their tail turned back, lest
they should be compelled to hear the words again reiterated?
For assoon as they hear them, they contrary to their nature and
cunning do forthwith lie immoveable, and do pursue or hurt no
man with their venemous biting, when notwithstanding otherwise
they on the sudden fly from the noise of a mans going as soon
as they hear it, and turn into their holes.” From whence it is manifest
that <em>Paracelsus</em> knew of his own experience that the charm
(which it seems he knew) would make Serpents lie immoveable,
and so that there was power and efficacy in words naturally without
superstition to work and operate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>P. 88.</div>

<p class='c008'>Also the learned person <em>Tobias Tandlerus</em> Doctor of Physick and
publick Professor at <em>Witteberge</em>, in his smart and pithy Oration <i><span lang="la">de
fascino &#38; incantatione</span></i>, tells us this: “That <em>Tuccia</em> a Woman belonging
to the Temple of <em>Vesta</em> being accused of Incest, did by
the help of prayer carry water in a sieve, as <em>Pliny</em> witnesseth:
<em>lib.</em> 28. <em>c.</em> 2. <em>natur. Histor.</em> Who there with many examples, doth
extol the efficacy of words. And further saith: They are found
that stay wild beasts with words, that they escape not the throwing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>of the dart. And those that render Rats being seen in any
place, stupid with secret murmuring, that they may be taken with
the hand and strangled.”</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Augerius Ferrerius</em>, whom <em>Thuanus</em> calls <i><span lang="la">Medicus Doctissimus</span></i>, in
his treating of Homerical medication, after he hath quoted Galen’s
recantation from <em>Trallianus</em>, and divers arguments and examples
to prove the efficacy of words, charms and characters from him,
from <em>Aetius</em> and others, he concludeth thus: <i><span lang="la">Quorum experientiam

videris, quid facies? Nam iis quæ sensibus exposita sunt contravenire,
sani hominis non est: Doctorum vero experimenta infirmare,

<p class='c008'>Lastly, for authorities sake we shall add the opinion of sagacious
<em>Helmont</em>, who writ a Book by him styled, <i><span lang="la">In verbis, herbis, &#38; lapidibus
est magna virtus</span></i>; and of the efficacy of words saith only
thus much: <i><span lang="la">De magna virtute verborum quædam ingenuè dixi, quæ
magis admiror quam applico</span></i>. By which it is manifest that though
<em>Helmont</em> did not make use of words or charms, yet knowing the efficacy
of them he could not but admire them.</p>

<p class='c008'>These authorities joyned with the examples may suffice to convince
any rational man that at some times and places, and by some
persons, the using of charms have produced strange effects: and
therefore taking the matter of fact to be a truth, we should come
to examine the cause of these effects; but first it will be necessary to
premise some cautions and necessary considerations, which we shall
pursue in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. We are to consider the intricacy and difficulty of this point,
which hath exercised the wits of the learned in all ages, and forced
<em>Pliny</em> to say: <i><span lang="la">Maximæ quæstionis, &#38; semper incertæ est, valeantne
aliquid verba &#38; incantamenta càrminum</span></i>. And again more particularly:
<i><span lang="la">Varia circa hæc opinio, ex ingenio cujusq; vel casu, mulceri
alloquio foras: quippe ubi etiam Serpentes extrahi cantu cogiq;
in pœnas, verum falsumne sit, vita non decreverit</span></i>. It seems by <em>Pliny</em>
that learned men of old have been very much divided in their opinions
about this matter, insomuch that he dares not take upon
him to decide it, but leaves it free to every man to believe as they
shall see cause. And therefore we ought not to be condemned, if
we do not absolutely decide it neither, it is enough if we bring so
much light to the matter that it may be better understood, though
not absolutely determined, <i><span lang="la">In magnis voluisse sat est</span></i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid.</em> Credul. and Incredul. <em>p.</em> 101.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Again we are to note that some Authors of great credit and
learning do hold these things to be but meer <em>Aniles fabulæ</em>, of which
opinion (it seems) <em>Aristotle</em>, and <em>Galen</em> were, though <em>Trallianus</em>
doth affirm (though some say falsly) that he made a retractation of
that opinion, and this was the judgment of the learned Spaniard
<em>Valesius</em>, who in his book, <i><span lang="la">De sacra Philosophia</span></i>, hath taken great
pains to perswade men, though he deny not supernatural operations
by Devils and Spirits, that inchanting by magical words are impossible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>and whatsoever is alledged by any ancient or late writer to
that purpose, he doth reject as meerly fabulous. But upon as good
grounds may any one reject this his single opinion as fabulous, because
there are a whole cloud of witnesses against him, of as great
credit and authority as himself, and experience every day will make
it manifest, that great effects do follow from the appension of charms
and characters, not determining here whether they cause those effects
causally as efficients, or but meerly accidentally and occasionally,
and therefore in this point Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> saith well: “As for <em>Valesius</em>
opinion (he saith) though a learned Man, and for ought I know
Pious and Wise, yet it is no wonder to me, that any one man,
though pious and learned, should fall into an opinion very Paradoxical
and contrary to most other mens belief, especially in a thing
of this nature, which most depends of experience.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist. 2.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Notwithstanding all this, for the most part all charms, spells
and characters are inefficacious, fallacious, superstitious and groundless,
and hardly fit for an honest and wise man to use, except only to
settle the imaginations of patients, that they may more readily and
hopefully take those things that may effectually cure them. I say
for the most part, not alwayes, because I grant that they do sometimes
either efficiently or accidentally produce real effects. But that
they are sometimes fallacious is manifest in the Charmer of <em>Saltzburg</em>,
who though with his charms he could prevail against the little
serpents, yet that great one that came prevailed against him, and
threw him into the ditch and killed him. And how vain it is to
put any confidence in these idle trifles, and how fallacious and ineffectual
and destructive they are, may appear by two deplorable
examples. <i><span lang="la">Amatus Lusitanus</span></i>, a learned and experienced Physician;
and a man of great repute and veracity doth relate this: “That in
the end of the Spring, the Summer coming on, two young men
did go from <em>Ancona</em> to the City <em>Auximum</em>, and by the way, the
one of them turning aside to make water, found a Viper in an hole
at the bottom of a Tree, with a great deal of rejoicing, but with
an unhappy success. He did contend with his companion, that
he could take the Viper with his hand, without any hurt, and
did brag that with the murmuring of certain words, he could
make all Serpents obey him, lying still as stupid. The other did
laugh him to scorn. At last they come to a wager. But the Viper
more audacious than was right, remained always truculent and
unaltered. At last when he stretched forth his hand to take her,
it being stirred up with a mad and venemous fury, lifting up the
neck did bite him in the finger, which beginning to pain him,
he quickly put his finger to his mouth perhaps to suck forth the
blood, but within a small while the unhappy young man died by
his own fault, neither did medical helps yield him any succour,
but he might have escaped, if he had not put the poyson of the
Serpent to his mouth.” And this wofull example may be a sufficient
warning to all that they be not too hasty to put confidence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>these fallacious trifles. Another story we shall give of our own
knowledge, and is this. “I had dismembred a pretty Young-mans
leg by reason of a Gangrene, his name <em>Robert Taylor</em>, a good Scholar,
and had been a Clerk to a Justice of Peace, and about three
weeks after when the stump was near healed, I being gone from
home, his Mother lying in the same room with him, but having
gotten too much drink, he calling upon her to help him to the
Close-stool, but she not hearing, he scrambled up himself as well
as he could, but hit the end of the stump that was not quite closed,
whereby the arteries were opened, and a great Hemorrhage
followed. And there being an honest simple man that owed the
house where he lay, having a vain confidence that with a charm
he said he had, he could undoubtedly stay the bleeding, and
therefore would not suffer them to call up my man to stay the Flux
until day; which continuing so long, the vain and fruitless charm
prevailing nothing, though my man when he came did stop it,
yet had he lost so much blood that he died the next day;” and this
may serve for a sufficient caution against vain confidence in
charms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Morbo Sacro</span></i> <em>lib. Sect.</em> 3. <em>p.</em> 301.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. Further we are to consider, that there are many notorious
impostures, frauds and cheats committed upon the poor ignorant,
credulous and silly common people, while some make the people
believe that their diseases are inflicted by such and such Saints, and
therefore they must use such and such strange lustrations, suffumigations
and other vain superstitious Rites and Ceremonies. Others
pretend to drive away evil Spirits by exorcisms and conjurations,
and others to cure all diseases (in a manner) with words, charms,
characters, amulets, and the like, when the most of these pretenders
are meer ignorant Knaves and Impostors, that do nothing but cheat
the too credulous people of their money, and defame and dishonour
the most noble Art of Medicine, of which we have known divers
sorts, some of which we have mentioned before in this Treatise.
To such as these that ancient Author (supposed by some to be <em>Hippocrates</em>)
<i><span lang="la">De morbo sacro</span></i>, doth give sufficient reproof, and of whom
he saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Ac mihi certè qui primi hunc morbum ad Deos retulerunt.
tales esse videntur, quales sunt magi, expiatores, circulatores,
ac arrogantes ostentatores, qui se valde pios esse plurimumq; scire
simulant</span></i>. A most large Catalogue of these kind of pestiferous impostors,
and many others, you have at full and to the life painted
forth by <em>Paracelsus</em> in his Preface to his less Chirurgery, where he
hath sufficiently stigmatized them with all those wicked marks and
brands that justly belong unto them. The same also is fully performed
by learned <em>Langius</em> in his Epistles, to whom I referr the
readers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Consid. 5.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>5. We are to consider that though we should grant that words
or charms had in them no energie, nor efficiency at all, by any natural
power, and that the Devils power doth not concur to make
them operative; yet (as we have partly shewed before) they are of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>singular use and benefit to a learned Physician, whereby he may
settle the fancies of his patients, to cause them more chearfully and
confidently to commit them to his hands, and to take what he shall
order and prescribe them, and this manner of their use is no way to
be dispraised or condemned, and we leave it as excepted forth of the
dispute we have in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are chiefly three opinions, amongst those that grant the
truth of the matter of fact concerning the proper cause of these effects
produced by words. 1. Of which the first sort are those that
hold there is no efficiency at all in the words themselves, which are
nothing but the sign of the league and compact betwixt the Charmer
and the Devil, and that whatsoever is brought to pass is only
effected by the Devils power, and of this opinion are the greatest
part of the learned. 2. Are those that hold that the words or
charms are but means to heighten the imagination, and that it is
the strength of the exalted imagination only that produceth those
things that seem to be effected by those words or charms, and of
this opinion was <em>Avicen</em> and many of the Arabians, <em>Ferrerius</em>, <em>Montanus</em>
and many others. 3. There are those that hold that there
is a natural efficiency in words and characters rightly fitted and conjoined
together in proper and agreeable constellations, and of this
opinion were <em>Johannes Ludovicus de la Cerda</em>, <em>Johannes Branus</em>,
<i><span lang="la">Camisius Lusitanus</span></i>, <em>Paracelsus</em>, <em>Galeottus Martius</em>, <em>Henricus Cornelius
Agrippa</em>, and many others; and of these we shall speak in
order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason 1. against this opinion.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. The first opinion doth take up a false supposition for its ground,
to wit that the Devil doth make a visible and corporeal league with
the Charmer, by virtue of which compact the effects are produced;
and if this compact be not explicite, yet it may be implicite, and
so the Devil operateth the effects, thereby to draw the Charmer
into his league and service: But we have before sufficiently proved
the nullity of any such Covenant, and shewed plainly that it is a
false, impious and diabolical Tenent, and that there is not, nor can
be any other league betwixt the Devil and wicked men, but what
is spiritual, internal and mental, and therefore that the Devil doth
not bring those effects to pass, by pretence of a league, that hath no
being or existence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason 2. against this opinion.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. We have proved by the unanimous consent of all the whole
army of the learned, that the Devil can work no alteration or
change in natural bodies, but by the applying of fit agents to agreeable
patients; but what agent could the Devil have applied to
make the iron that stuck in the Souldiers shoulder-bone related by
<em>Benevenius</em>, to come forth without pain? surely none at all. For
where an agent in nature is awanting to produce an effect, there the
Devil must needs also be lame, and can effect nothing; and if either
the words had a sufficient natural power to cause the iron
to come forth, or the Souldiers imagination exalted by confidence
in the Charm and Charmer, then the Devils help is in vain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>implored, or he brought in to be an actor of that he hath no power
at all to perform, and there was no other natural agent applied,
and therefore it must of necessity be one of the two that produced
the effect, and not a Demon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason 3. against this opinion.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Spong. Fosterianæ expressio.</em> <em>c.</em> 2. <em>p.</em> 7, <em>&#38;c.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. It cannot in any reason be imagined that the Devil, that for
the space of above five thousand years hath been the bitter and inveterate
enemy to the health of Man both in Soul and Body, should
now be become a Physician &#38; an healer. We read that God sent forth
evil Angels amongst the people, but he sent forth his word and
they were healed. But it is manifest that the evil Angels since their
fall, are ordained of God to be the instruments and organs for the
executing of his wrath, and the good Angels are his ministring Spirits
for the good of his people both in Souls and Bodies: and therefore
that the Devil should be the author, or instrument of curing
any disease at all, were to make him to act contrary to that end for
which God hath ordained him, for he is the destroyer, that is ordained
to destroy, but not to heal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason 4. against this opinion.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Miscell. Medic. Suet.</em> <em>lib.</em> 6. <em>Epist.</em> 17. <em>p.</em> 284.</div>

<p class='c008'>4. But we shall take another argument or two from the learned
pen of <em>Henricus Brucæus</em> in his Epistle to <em>Thomas Erastus</em>, where about
this point he saith this: “What is that (he saith) that the
most of the Grecian Physicians were ignorant of Demons; or that
it should be agreeable to truth, that they have not judged that
Demons had any power either in inflicting or taking away any diseases?
For that sentence of <em>Hippocrates</em>, that there is somewhat
that is divine in diseases. <em>Galen</em> doth shew in his Comment how it
is to be understood, and <em>Hippocrates</em> himself in that Treatise of the
Falling-sickness doth sufficiently open it. Notwithstanding these
chief men being Physicians and Philosophers, by whom the power
of natural things and words was principally looked into; they
were more willing to assent to things that were evidently apparent,
than take away the force of incantation by it self. By it self (he
saith) Because they have had no remembrance of Demons, from
whom the causes of such effects, which follow incantations, do seem
only they can possibly be derived.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason 5. against this opinion.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. Before he argueth thus: “But the curation of diseases, which
are performed by conjurations and imprecations, he ascribeth
unto the Devil. Notwithstanding (he saith) some things do move
a scruple to me, because that some things of them do seem to be
of that kind, which cannot at all be referred to Demons, in
which no league or compact doth seem to interceed. For leagues
or compacts seem to be contracted, for that also those things comprehended
are to be performed to those that Covenant, that by
that means those that Covenant with him, may be withdrawn
from the worship of the true God, or that some may be confirmed
in their impiety. Which causes in Men to whom the true God is
utterly unknown, have no place; for neither are they to be withdrawn
from the true God, whom they altogether ignore, or to be
confirmed in impiety, when they have been brought up in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>worship of Idols from their tender years. For (he saith) <em>Aloisius
Cádamústus</em> in the 18 Chap. of the Indian Navigations relateth, that
Serpents seeking to destroy Sheep in the Kingdom of <em>Senega</em>,
which is given to Idolatrous Worship, they will on the night aim
by heaps at the Sheep-folds, from whence they are driven away
with certain conceived words, and this reason is not unknown to
many others. And that <em>Trallianus</em> where he treateth of the stone,
acknowledgeth the force of incantations in healing of diseases,
and he witnesseth that <em>Galen</em> himself, taught by experience, did
come over to this opinion.” For though <em>Galen</em> before (as we have
shewed) did account charms but as <em>Aniles fabulæ</em>, yet this Author
<em>Trallianus</em> doth quote a piece of <em>Galens</em>, wherein he maketh a
retractation of that opinion, and it standeth with good reason that
it might be so, <em>Trallianus</em> living near his time, and so might (notwithstanding
what <em>Guitterrius</em> bawleth to the contrary) have that
part of his writing that since might be lost; for I remember <em>Paracelsus</em>
somewhere saith that in his travels he found the works of
<em>Galen</em>, far more genuine and incorrupt than those that were published
and extant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason 6. against this opinion.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ut supra.</span></i></div>

<p class='c008'>6. A further reason this Author gives us thus: “Furthermore
(he saith) that it is not impious to frame to cure a disease with
conceived words, and cannot be perswaded to believe it, especially
seeing that those diseases that are caused by Magick, are
only to be cured by Magick. But (he saith) I confess that compacts
with Demons are not to be entred into, but that compacts
being entred into with others, should pass to another, and should
bind with the same impiety, that is not agreeable to truth, seeing
that the consent of those that make the league, doth effect and
confirm the compacts. Which if it be (he saith) far absent from
us (that is a compact) and in the use of conceived words, by
which the malady is taken away, there be contained nothing that
is impious, and that we implore the divine assistance; I do not
see (he saith) any thing hurtful to Religion, nor unbeseeming
a good and Pious Man. For as if things that are salutiferous to
mankind, should come from Men that were Atheists, we should
imbrace them, not respecting the Authors: So if (he saith) things
that are profitable should be shewed of a Demon, I should not think
they were to be rejected.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reason 7. against this opinion.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Hist.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>7. Lastly he saith: “Why may we not also refer effects in the
sanation of diseases, which do accompany the enunciation or description
of conceived words, to those we call good or guardian
Angels? Why should we not judge that these would be as ready
to ease and help, as others to hurt, especially in diseases, where
we are destitute of natural helps? And this opinion (he saith)
<i><span lang="la">Constantinus magnus</span></i> did approve, <i><span lang="la">Codicis</span></i> <em>lib.</em> 9. <em>tit.</em> 10. <em>leg.</em> 4.
The Science of them (he saith) is to be punished, who being skilled
in Magical Arts are discovered either to endeavour the impairing
the health of men, or the drawing of chast minds to lust.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>But for seeking remedies to humane bodies, they ought not to be
punished. But perhaps thou wilt say, that words are in vain muttered
forth, unless a compact do interceed. But that which happened
(he saith) at <em>Lipsick</em> some twelve or fifteen years since, doth
refell this opinion, where a little Wench, that by reason of her
age did not know what she did, while she imitated the whole action
of her nurse, which she had often seen her use, and therewith
stirred up tempests; herewith the little Wench raised up
such Thunders and Lightenings, by which a Village, not far
from the City was burned: As (he saith) D. <em>Nenius</em> told him,
and was a thing known to innumerable Citizens. For the Wench
being brought to the Court, it was debated whether by law she
could be punished, but it was decided by the opinions of the
Lawyers, that she could not be punished, seeing that by reason of
her young age, she was altogether ignorant of what she did.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De superst. &#38; Ceremon.</span></i> <em>l. p.</em> 451.</div>

<p class='c008'>8. We cannot also but remember here some notable passages of
<em>Paracelsus</em> where he is speaking of the power of faith and strong
confidence, meerly considered as a nude and natural power: And
affirming its great force and operation to effect strange things, he
saith: “But truly we cannot deny, but that spirits do commix themselves
with such a faith, in celebrated feasts, and the like, as
though they had performed those things. But not at all they,
but faith only doth these things: As if a Man had honey, and did
not know from whence it came, nor what kind of creature did
make it, and the Beetle should brag that she had made it.” So
the Devils though they perform nothing at all, but the effects are
meerly produced by the power of a natural or miraculous faith,
yet they glory as though they had done them (in all things being
liars and deceivers) and therefore do they what they can to
confirm and raise up ceremonies and superstitions; From which
commotions faith is brought forth, and faith worketh those strange
effects, and therefore by reason of the superstition used, the Devils
would make men believe that they are authors of those strange
effects, which are onely wrought by the Power of an humane
Faith, that they might rob God of his Glory and have it ascribed
unto themselves. And therefore no persons do the Devils more
service than those that ascribe those works unto them that are
wrought by natural power and the strength of humane faith. From
whence he concludeth thus: <i><span lang="la">Eodem modo fides est in homine, ut
laqueus quo strangulatur fur, ad multa utilis sit. Ea fides facit, ut
fiat. Si fides etiam in filum lineum est, similiter fit. Interim tamen
hoc nec Diabolus facit, nec fur, nec laqueus, nec carnifex: sed
adulterina tua fides, quam non impendis ut debebas.</span></i></p>

<p class='c008'>Having sufficiently (we suppose) proved that in the producing
the effects by words or charms, the Devil doth operate nothing
at all in them, but only as a lying deceiver and Impostor, laboureth
to have the honour of those effects ascribed unto him; we shall
now come to the second, and that is those that hold that the effects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>are solely produced by the force of the imagination and faith of the
Charmer, and so that imagination doth work further than the proper
body of the imaginant, upon other extraneous bodies, and that
the words or characters avail nothing, but the fortifying and exalting
of the faith of the Operator, to prove which are brought these
arguments.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. When the Disciples asked our Saviour, Why they could not
cast forth the Devil out of the child that was lunatick, and sore
vexed, and oft fell into the fire, and into the water, he told them;
<em>Because of their unbelief</em>, and said: <em>For verily I say unto you, if ye
have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,
remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall
be impossible unto you</em>. Upon which place learned <em>Beza</em> gives us
this note: <i><span lang="la">Non fidem illam generalem &#38; historicam intelligit: Nec
etiam fidem justificantem. Sed illam demum specialem, &#38; quibusdam
Christianis particularem, quâ animus quodam spiritus sancti
impulsu ad res mirandas perficiendas impellitur, &#38; ista vocatur fides
miraculorum.</span></i> And against diffidence our Saviour orders the
remedy of fasting and prayer: But this was a power given by Christ
unto them, which they (it seems) had lost, and are here taught to
resuscitate it by prayer and fasting. Others take it to be a natural
power of faith or strength of imagination in all men, which they
may stir up by fasting and prayer, therewith to operate that which
is good, but being suscitated by the means of images, pictures, superstitious
ceremonies, and the like, and so may effect either good
or bad; but this later opinion we reject as unsound, and contrary
to the Scriptures, and so the argument doth prove very little.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. de inject. mater. 601, 602.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. <em>Helmont</em> holdeth, “that every man, in respect that they have
been partakers of the image of God, hath power to create certain
entities, by the power of imagination, and that these conceived
Ideas do cloath themselves with a body in the shape of the
image fabricated in the imagination, and it is by these that those
strange things are effected, that are falsly attributed to Demons.”
And that man solely hath this power. Which (if his argument be
well grounded) doth prove plainly, that these strange effects are
brought to pass by the sole power of the phantasie of the person imaginant,
or using the charms, and neither by the power of the Devil
nor of the charms.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The argument to prove these things by, that they are brought

is this: <i><span lang="la">Non mediocri experientia (ait) comprobatum est, insitam a
natura homini, quandam dominandi, &#38; ligandi vim</span></i>. And that
there is an active terror in man, (if it be rightly resuscitated in him,
and that he know how to direct and make use of it) impressed in
him by the Creator, which is as it were a terrifical character and
signacle of God instamped upon man, by which all creatures do
fear, and reverence man, as the image of his Creator, and as by the
law of creation, to be Lord, and to bear rule over them all. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>here I cannot but mention that lepid (though tedious &#38; ludicrous) tale
that Dr. <em>Casaubon</em> gives us of an horse-rider called <em>John Young</em>, “that
could tame the most fierce Bulls and unruly Horses, as also by pipeing
to make the most couragious and fierce Mastiff to lie close
down and to be quiet, by the force of his imagination and charms.
And this <em>John Young</em>’s Philosophy was agreeable to this of <em>Agrippa</em>’s,
to wit, That all creatures were made by God, for the use of Man
and to be subject unto him; and that if men did use their power

<p class='c008'>4. <em>Avicenna</em>, <em>Algazel</em>, <em>Alkindus</em>, <em>Marsilius Ficinus</em>, <i><span lang="la">Jacobus de
Forluio</span></i>, <em>Pomponatius Paracelsus</em> and others, do sometimes hold,
“that the Soul (the sensitive and corporeal it must be understood)
not by a nude apprehension, or meer impery, but by the emission
of spirits (or corporeal beams, as we have shewed before) do
work upon external bodies, and so move and alter them. Sometimes
they hold, that the whole Soul (sensitive must be meant)
doth go quite forth of the Body, and wander into far distant places,
and there not only see what things are done, but also to act
something it self.” And to this opinion (only meaning of the immortal,
and immaterial Soul) Dr. <em>Moore</em> and Mr. <em>Glanvil</em> do seem
to agree, namely that the Soul may for a time depart forth of its Body,
and return again. And to prove this the argument of <em>Avicen</em>
is this: Superior things (he saith) have dominion over the inferior,
and the Intelligences do rule and change corporeal things. And that
the Soul is a spiritual and separable substance. And therefore after
the same manner, may act in corporeal things, and change them as
may be seen at large, with responsions in the book of <em>Fienus</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now we come to the third and last opinion of those that positively
hold, that there is a force in words and characters (if rightly
framed) to effect strange things withal, and this is as strongly
denied by many. Therefore we shall only offer the most convincing
arguments, that we meet withal, and leave it to the censure
of others, and that in this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>But before we enter upon the positive arguments, we think it
fit, lest we be mistaken (though in part we may have touched
some of them before) to lay down some few cautions and considerations,
which we shall do in this manner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Consid. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De mirab. pot. Art. &#38; Nat.</span></i> <em>c.</em> 2.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">De Occult. Philos.</span></i> <em>p.</em> 484.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. It is to be taken for a certain truth, that the greatest part of
those pretended charms and characters that are in this our age used
by ignorant, superstitious, and cheating impostors; are utterly
false, and of no power or efficacy at all. And this was understood
by our learned Countreyman <em>Roger Bacon</em>, who tells us thus much.
“For without all doubt (he saith) all of this sort now a days are
false, or doubtful or irrational, and therefore not at all to be
trusted unto.” And to this doth <em>Paracelsus</em> fully agree, saying:
“All characters are not to be trusted to, or any confidence to be
placed in them, nor in like manner in words. For the Nigromancers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and Poets, being very laboriously imployed about them,
have filled all Books with comments proceeding forth of their
brains, wanting all truth and foundation, of which some thousands
are not worth one deaf nut.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Consid. 2.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. ut supra.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>2. Yet for all this we are to consider, that all of them are not
totally to be rejected, for <em>Bacon</em> tells us: “That there are certain deprecations
of ancient times instituted of men, or rather ordained
of God and good Angels, that are both true and efficacious; and
such like as these may retain their first virtue. As in some Countreys
(he saith) yet some certain prayers are made upon red hot
iron, and upon the water of the flood, and likewise upon other
things, by which the innocent are tried, and the guilty condemned.”
And this was the trial that by the Saxons (when used in <em>England</em>)
was called <span class='blackletter'>Ordeall</span>. Therefore <em>Paracelsus</em> saith thus: <i><span lang="la">Repeto
ergo, characteribus &#38; verbis non omnibus fidendum esse, sed
eligenda &#38; retinenda, quæ recta, genuina, ex fundamento veritatis
deprompta, ac multoties probata sint</span></i>, which is counsel good, sound
and profitable. And somewhere he tells us that even those true and
genuine characters and Gamahuis that were rightly fabricated under
due constellations, and were in old time efficacious, may have
now lost their virtue because the configurations of the Heavens are
altered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Confid. 3.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ubi supra.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. Many of these strange characters or words were not by wise
men inserted into their works, that thereby any strange things might
be wrought by them, but were invented to conceal those grand
secrets that they would not have to be made known unto the unworthy.
And therefore <em>Bacon</em> gives us this profound and honest
counsel: “So therefore (he saith) there are very many things concealed
in the books of the Philosophers, by sundry ways: In
which a Wise Man ought to have this prudence, that he pass by
the charms and characters, and make trial of the work of nature
and art: And so he shall see, as well animate things, as inanimate,
to concur together, by reason of the conformity of nature, not
because of the virtue of the charm or character. And so many
secrets both of Nature and Art are of the unlearned, esteemed to be
magical. And Magicians do foolishly confide in charms and characters,
judging virtue to be in them, and because of their vain
confidence in them, they forsake the work of Nature and Art, by
reason of the error of charms and characters. And so both these
sort of Men are deprived of the benefit of wisdom, their own foolishness
so compelling them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Confid. 4.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vt supra</em> 1. 2.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. The same most learned Countryman of ours <em>Roger Bacon</em>,
doth further give us this advice saying: “But those things that are
contained in the books of Magicians ought by right to be banished,
although they have in them something of truth: Because
they are mixed with falsities, that it cannot be discerned betwixt
that which is true, and that which is false. And also Impostors and
ignorant persons have feigned and forged divers writings under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>the names of ancient wise men, thereby to allure the curious, and
to deceive the unwary, which with great care and consideration
we ought to eschew. To the same purpose <em>Paracelsus</em> doth caution
us in this point. <i><span lang="la">Cuilibet ergo promptum sit, characteres &#38;
verba quævis discernere posse.</span></i>”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Consid. 4.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>4. But for all this (as we have often intimated before) charms
and characters though in themselves of none effect, may conduce
to heighten the fancy and confidence of a Patient, and render him
more willing to take those things that may cure. And to this purpose,
the forementioned Author <em>Roger Bacon</em>, from <em>Constantine</em>
the Physician tells us thus much: “But it is to be considered, that
a skilful Physician, or any other, that would excite and stir
up the mind, may profitably make use of charms and characters
though feigned, not because the characters or charms themselves
do operate any thing, but that the medicine may be received
with more desire and devotion, and that the mind of the Patient
may be stirred up, and may confide more freely, and may hope
and rejoice; Because the Soul being excitated, can renew many
things in its proper body, so that from infirmity it may be restored
to health by joy and confidence. If therefore (he saith)
a Physician to magnifie his work, that the Patient may be raised
up to hope and confidence, shall do any thing of this nature, not
for fraud, but because of this, that he may confide, that he may
be healed, it is not to be condemned.” We brought this authority
to confirm what we had asserted before; and that these things are
wonderfully prevalent, we have before shewed examples.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 1.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'>Numb. 6. 27.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Ezek. 9. 4, 6.</div>

<p class='c008'>1. There are some, that to prove that words and characters have
a natural efficacy, do alledge some passages of Scripture, which we
shall propose as very probable, but not as necessarily convincing,
and the first is this: <em>And they shall put my name upon the children
of Israel, and I will bless them</em>. Which some understand that the
name <em>Jehovah</em> which they call <em>Tetragrammaton</em>, was worn upon
them, and that thereby they were blessed, and from thence they
suppose that Hebrew names, especially that, are very efficacious and
powerful. Another is: <em>The man cloathed in linnen, that had the
Ink-horn by his side</em>, is commanded to set a mark, or (as some read
it) a <em>Tau upon those that mourned</em>. This is the name of a letter the
“last in the Alphabet, and hath in the old books of the Hebrews (as
<em>Schindlerus</em> tells us) the figure of a cross, and such like the <em>Samaritans</em>
use to this day. From whence by <em>Tau</em>, some in <em>Ezekiel</em>
do understand the figure of the Cross of Christ.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Chirug. major.</em> <em>c.</em> 8. <em>p.</em> 22.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. But to explicate what is meant by charms and characters, we
are to note that it is not to be understood of those words that are
by humane institution significant according to the imposition of
men, nor of any sort of charms or characters, but of such, as by
wise men are duly fitted and joined together, in and under a right
and favourable constellation, for it is from the Influence of the Stars
(as we have proved before) that words, charms, images and characters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>do receive their energie and virtue. And to this purpose is
the true rendition of the words in the Psalm. <em>Which hearkeneth
not to the voice of those that mutter, the conjunction of the learned
joyner</em>. That is, that the Serpent doth not hearken unto, or obey
the charms that are framed or joined together by the learned joiner
or framer of charms. So that there is a great learning required to
frame and compose charms rightly that they may be efficacious. For
<em>Paracelsus</em> witnesseth that Serpents once hearing an efficacious
charm do forthwith stop their ears, lest they should hear the words
repeated again. Of both these sorts the learned <em>Roger Bacon</em> doth
tell us this: “Of characters therefore according to the first manner,
it is so to be judged as we have shewed in common speech:
But of sigills and characters of the second manner, unless they be
made in elected seasons, they are known to have no efficacy at all.
And therefore he that doth practise them, as they are described in
books, not respecting but only the figure that the exemplar doth
represent, is judged of every wise man to do nothing. But those
which know to perform their work in fit constellations according
to the face of the Heavens; those may not only dispose characters
but all their works, both of Art and Nature, according to the
virtue of the Stars. But because it is a difficult thing to understand
the certainty of Celestials in these things, therefore in these
things there is much error with many, and there are few that understand
to order any thing profitably and truly.” And to this
purpose <em>Paracelsus</em> tells us: “Certain Chirurgical Arts invented
of the first improvers of Astronomy, by which admirable
things were (by an Ethereal virtue) performed. But these after
the decease of the ancient Magicians, were so lost, were as scarce
any footsteps do now remain. But it was the Art of Celestial impressions,
that they might draw down, the influent action, into
some corporeal substance. The thing is plain by example. The
seed of a Rose doth obtain the virtue and nature of a Rose, yet
for all that it is not a Rose, but when being put into the earth,
it doth sprout, then at the last it produceth a Rose. By the same
reason, there are certain celestial virtues and actions in being,
which being sown into Gemms, which were called of the ancient
Magicians, <em>Peantides</em> and <em>Gamahii</em> (otherwise <em>gemmæ huyæ</em>) from
whence they have afterwards sprung up, no otherwise than seed,
which doth fall from the Tree, and doth regerminate. This was
that Astronomie of the ancient <em>Ægyptians</em> and <em>Persians</em>, by which
they did adorn Gemms with celestial virtues. Neither are these
things forthwith to be reputed impossible: For if we believe, that
the Heaven doth send the Plague and other diseases upon us, why
may we not hope, that the benignity of its virtues may be communicated
to us also? In like manner if the Heaven doth act upon
the bodies of men, why may we not think that they may wrest their
darts into stones? Many are touched with such like celestial darts
which a Magician who hath skill of the Firmament, may easily (if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>they be noxious) shun: or if they be benign shall, by putting
some body, communicate it to that body, that now that body may
fully obtain into it self the virtue of that dart or influence. From
whence stones are found amongst the <em>Ægyptians</em>, which being born
do cause diseases: But again there are others, that do throughly
make sound those diseases. So (he saith) we have seen <em>Gemmas
Huyas</em>, that is <em>Peantides</em>, wherein the sign of the <em>Sagittary</em> was
insculped against weapons, which were prevalent against wounds
made with Swords. Also we have known (he saith) that Magicians
have rendered stones efficacious to cure Feavers: nor only
to have made them strong to cure diseases, but also wounds,
and their symptoms, to wit, the Hæmorrhage, the Sinonia (or
sinew-water) Convulsions, and the Epilepsie. But as in that age
the use of these was frequent, and the authority great; so by little
and little the sophistications of false Philosophers being increased,
they have come into desuetude and contempt, and other
childish things have been substituted in their places. But
these Stones (because now the site and influx of the Heavens are
plainly otherwise than they were in times past) are no more so efficacious
as they were then, therefore it is convenient that they be
prepared anew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Art Magick, because it was more secret, nor known to
vulgar Philosophers, both because it did ingenerate wonderful
virtues, not only to Stones, but also to such like words, begun
to be called the prestigious Art by an odious term. For men being
unskilful of these things, who notwithstanding did usurp the
title of the Art unto themselves, addicted themselves unto artificious
operations, crosses and exorcisms: From thence the vulgar,
being unskilful of the Magical Art, have begun to attribute
this virtue to exorcisms, characters, short prayers, signacles,
crosses, and to other frivolous things. But the matter (he saith)
is quite otherwise: for the constellation under which the stones and
words are prepared, doth induce the virtues, not exorcisms.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Explic. Astronom.</em> <em>p.</em> 654.</div>

<p class='c008'>And being entred upon this particular, we shall add some things
to this more fully, as first this from the great <em>Georgius Phædro</em>, who
saith, after he had shewed the great virtue of some Roots and Herbs
in curing wounds and ulcers: “But a Characteristical cure is that,
which exerciseth its natural power by words pronounced, written
or ingraven, by the qualities celestial and various influences of
the Stars, being friendly to our bodies. And to this doth fully
agree, what is written by <em>Trallianus</em> at large and <em>Augerius Ferrerius</em>
in his Chapter <i><span lang="la">de Homerica medicatione</span></i>, whither I referr
the Reader, and conclude this explication with that sentence of
<em>Paracelsus</em>: <i><span lang="la">Præterea syderibus nota sunt omnia, quæ in natura
existunt. Vnde (inquit) sapiens dominabitur astris, is sapiens,
qui virtutes illas ad sui obedientiam cogere potest.</span></i>”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 3.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>3. What is here fully explicated as also what we have formerly in
this Treatise proved both by reasons, authorities and examples doth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>sufficiently manifest the great power of Celestial Bodies upon inferior
matter, and that according to the aptitude and agreeableness of
the matter prepared, and the configuration of the Heavens at the
time elected, the powerful influence of the Stars and Planets is received
into the subject, according to the purpose it was intended
for. So that from hence it will clearly follow, that if fit and agreeable
words or characters be framed and joined together, when the
Heavens are in a convenient site and configuration for the purpose
intended, those words and characters will receive a most powerful
virtue, for the purpose intended, and will effectually operate to
those ends by a just, lawful and natural agency, without any concurrence
of Diabolical power, superstition or ceremonies, and this
is that which was laboured to be proved.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. <em>Thomas Bartholinus</em> that most learned Physician, and experienced
Anatomist (though his credit be laboured to be eclipsed
by Dr. <em>Casaubon</em>, who is always more ready to ascribe power unto
Devils, the worst of Gods creatures, than either to God or Nature)
doth (touching this point) asserts this: “Notwithstanding (he
saith) that words framed or shut up in a certain Rhythme, may
without any superstition work some such like thing as the curing
of the Epilepsie. For first, the air is altered by the various prolation
of words, as well that air, which doth enter into the little
pores of the vessels ending in the skin by transpiration, as that
which is carried into the Ears, Nostrils, and Lungs. 2. The
state being different of the words uttered, doth impress a different
force, which the unlike constitution of the rough Artery, and
of the rest of the instruments of speech, whether that state be hot
or cold, it impresseth a virtue, which doth either acuate or make
grave. 3. The breath is heated by the various prolation of words,
which either alone, or bound up in the Rhythme doth califie cold
things, and discusseth flatulencies.” And these may have a great
diversity in operation, according as the air and breath, and the several
kinds of Atomes in them, may be ordered in their site, motion,
and contexture, so that thereby the various effects may be
produced, without Cacodemons, or vain superstition.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. And if we consider it seriously there is something more than
ordinary in this place of Scripture. <em>And it came to pass, that
when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an
harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was
well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</em> Upon which learned
<i><span lang="la">Tremellius</span></i> gives us this note: “That evil spirit, that is, those phantastical
pangs, or that furious rage, which did proceed from that
evil spirit, did cease. So that it is manifest that it was the natural
efficacy of the melodious sound made by <em>Davids</em> playing upon
the Harp, whereby the Atomes of the air were put into such a motion,
site and contexture that thereby they became repugnant and
antipathetical to those contrary Atomes, that were by the means
of the evil spirit stirred up in the sensitive Soul of <em>Saul</em>, by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>he was terrified or tormented, and by overcoming them, and dissipating
of them, he came to be refreshed, and for a time those effects
wrought by that evil spirit ceased. So that the argument lies plain
thus: If the melody of tunes or sounds modulated upon an Harp,
have power to refresh the mind, and to cause the rage of an evil
spirit to cease; then may words rightly framed in agreeable
Rhythmes, which are but modulated tunes or sounds, ease sick persons,
and remove diseases: But the former is true by the testimony
of this Scripture, and so also is the later. Neither is the objection
of <em>Hieronymus Jordanus</em> against this of any force at all, where he
saith that the reason of sweet Harmony, and magical words, are
very far different. But it had been suitable for him to have shewed
us, wherein that difference doth lye, and not to have put it off
with such a pittiful shuffle, as that it is obvious to Tyronists. This
is (indeed) a shift used by many, that when they are not able to solve
the argument, they put it off with some impertinent diversion, or
passe by it with some ironical Sarcasm. But I must tell him, that
tunes and sounds, that are framed by art in the best ways that can
be devised, thereby by modulating of the air, to cause it to have
several effects upon the auditory organs, differ not at all from
right framed charms and characters, that by disposing the atomes
of the air several ways, do produce various effects; I say there is
no difference, except that constellated words may be more efficacious
than Musick, because they are by a most curious and secret art,
not only composed and joined together, but also are prepared at
such chosen and fit times, that the Heavens may more powerfully infuse
their virtues and influences into them, which is not observed in
the composition of tunes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. Athan. Kercher. l. magnet. mus.</em> <em>p.</em> 761. <em>&#38;c.</em></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Et Monfelt. insect. Theatr.</span></i> <em>p.</em> 220.</div>

<p class='c008'>6. There is no one thing (if true, and that <em>Kercherus</em> and others
have not told us abominable lies) that hath more induced me to believe
that there is some natural virtue in words and charms composed
in a right way or Rhythme, than because those that are stung, or
bitten with the <em>Tarantula</em>, or <em>Phalangium</em>, are cured with Musick,
and that not with any sort of Musick, but with certain proper and
peculiar tunes, which are diversified according to the colour of the
<em>Tarantula</em> that gave the venemous prick or bite, and so by dancing
they sweat forth the poison. And <em>Kercherus</em> further tells us not only
that those that are stung with the <em>Tarantula</em> are cured with Musick,
but that the <em>Tarantula</em>’s themselves with dance, when those tunes
are modulated, that are proportionable and agreeable to their humors.
Now if tunes modulated in proportionable and sympathizing
ways agreeable to the humours, do cure those that are stung,
then much more may words and charms rightly composed and joined
together, and that in a due selected time under a powerful constellation,
produce such effects as to cure diseases, and move animals
to divers and various motions; for betwixt the prolation of
words putting the Atomes of the air into a fit motion, site, figure,
and contexture suitable to perform the end intended, and the vibrating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>and various figuring the air in its motion by musical tunes,
there is no difference at all in respect of the material or efficient
cause, and so either of them may produce like effects.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 7.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>7. There is also an experiment that hath been sufficiently tryed
and attested, which doth much induce me to believe that there is
efficacy in words and charms above their significancy by imposition
and institution, and that is this. They take two Lutes rightly
stringed and laid upon a long table, and then they lay a light straw,
chaff, or feather upon the Unison string of the one, and then they
strike, or move the Unison string of the other Lute, that lieth at
the other end of the Table, by which motion of the Unison-string
at the one end of the Table, the straw, chaff or feather upon the
Unison-string of the Lute at the other end of the Table (though it
be of the longest sort) will by the vibration of the air be moved,
or struck off, and yet it will not do it, if the straw be laid upon any
other string, and then the Unison of the other Lute moved: By
which it is manifest that the striking or moving the Unison-string of
the one Lute doth so figurate and dispose the Atomes of the Air,
that they are fit and apt to move the Unison-string of the other
Lute, and so to make the straw fall off, as being of an agreeable.
mood and temper for the susception of the motion, which the rest
of the other strings (being of different degrees and nature) are not:
for the maxime is true, <i><span lang="la">Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis</span></i>.
And this being so, it must needs be also granted that words and
rhythms fitly joined and composed, being pronounced do put the
atomes of the air into such a site, motion, figure, and contexture,
that may at a distance operate upon the subject for which they are
so fitted, and produce such effects, as they were composed and
intended for: especially being framed under powerful and suitable
constellations, from whence they receive their greatest force.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Argum. 8.</em></div>

<p class='c008'>8. The chiefest objection that is usually brought against the natural
agency of fitly composed words or rhythms is a maxim of the
Schools, ill understood and worse applied, which is this: <i><span lang="la">Quantitates
rerum, nullius sunt efficaciæ</span></i>: unto which we shall render
these responsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. If quantity be taken mathematically, and abstractly, then it
is true, that it is of no efficacy or operation, because it is then only
<i><span lang="la">ens rationis</span></i>, and doth only exist in the intellect, and so can operate
nothing <i><span lang="la">ad extra</span></i>. But if it be taken concretely, physically,
and as materiate, than it is of force, and very operative, as two
pound quantity of lead will weigh down one pound of the same
lead, and two ounces quantity of the same Gunpowder, will carry
a bullet of the same quantity further, and more forceably, than
one ounce of the same will do: And one scruple of white <em>Hellebor</em>
may be taken, when a Drachm will kill, and a fire of a yard Diameter
will warm a man at a greater distance than a fire but of one
foot diameter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Vid. System. Harm. Log. Hen. Alstedii.</em> <em>p.</em> 251.</div>

<p class='c008'>2. Figures, characters, words or speech are (indeed) properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>no quantities: For figures and characters are only delineations and
circumscriptions of some kind of matter, and are all, whether natural
or artificial, properly contained under quality, and denoting what
figure or Form the thing is of. Figure therefore properly is attributed
to artificial things, as to a circle, a square, a triangle, and
the like; and form to animate things, as to a Man, an Horse, an
Oxe, and the like: And so characters whether ingraven in metals,
gemms, stones, clay, plaister or wood, or written upon parchment,
paper, or the like, of what figure or form soever they be, are but qualities,
and do qualifie the matter according to the form and figure impressed
in the subject matter, which being artificially done, the matter
is the patient, the figure or character is the exemplar cause, and the
force that maketh the impression is the efficient cause, and that these
as qualities have some efficacy, no rational man can deny.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Geom.</em> <em>l.</em> 19. <em>p.</em> 144.</div>

<p class='c008'>3. But to make it more clearly manifest, let us suppose three various
figures that are Isoperimetral, as a circle, a plain square, and
an equilateral triangle: Though they be all of equal circumference,
yet shall the circle contain more than either the square, or
the triangle; and therefore learned <em>Ramus</em> doth lay down this rule.
<i><span lang="la">Circulus è planis Isoperimetris inæqualibus est maximus.</span></i> But when
the question is asked, what is the cause, why a circle of figures
of equal circumference, contains the most? The answer is commonly
made, <i><span lang="la">Quia omnium figurarum perfectissimus, &#38; capacissimus
est circulus</span></i>; but if it be again urged, what is the cause, that a
circle of an equal circumference to a plain square, should be more
capacious than the square? Here (the thing being found true by
ocular experience) the capaciousness of the circle, more than the
square (they being both of equal circumference) can be ascribed to
nothing else at all, but only to the figure, and therefore of necessity,
figures have in them some efficiency.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. That which we call speech, or oration, is considered three
ways. 1. That which is mental and only conceived in the mind,
and not expressed. 2. That which is expressed or uttered by the
vocal organs. 3. And that which is written. And these are called
mental, vocal and written. The two, that is, mental, and that which
is written, are referred to the predicament of quality. And whereas
oration vocal is by some referred to the predicament of quantity,
as it is the measure of sounds and syllables, as it is pronounced,
whereof some are made long, and some short; and so while distinct
sounds and syllables are uttered in a certain mood, they are
said to be measured, and to belong to quantity: But if we will understand
aright, one thing in different respects may belong both
to the predicament of quantity and quality. So the prolation of
sounds or syllables in respect of their modification, and comparing
one to another, some may be long, and some may be short, and have
a different part of time in their pronunciation, and so may Analogically,
and by way of similitude, be said to be measured, and consequently
referred to the predicament of quantity. Yet if we consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>speech or oration, which consists of sounds and syllables, in
relation to the efficient cause, the material and instrumental, which
is the breath of Man by his several organs, moving, modulating and
figuring the air (which is the subject matter) into diversity of sites,
motions, contextures and moods, then we must conclude that words,
charms or rhythms, having efficient, material and instrumental causes,
do belong to the predicament of Quality, and are of great force
and virtue naturally, notwithstanding all that is or can be objected
to the contrary.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Alphabet. Natur.</em> <em>p.</em> 20.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Ibid.</em> <em>p.</em> 52.</div>

<p class='c008'>5. Lastly, we are to consider that the breath of Man being variously
modulated by its passage from the lungs, by the throat, palate,
tongue, and other vocal organs, doth make such several impressions
and configurations of the moved atomes in the air, that
thereby so great a diversity of impulses or sounds are made upon
the drum of the ear, that thereby naturally we are able to distinguish
one from another. Now humane institution found forth the
ways of making these several sounds, or tones, to be appropriated
to such and such things, or to signifie the diversity of creatures and
things, according to the several compacts and agreements of Men
amongst themselves, so that what one sound doth signifie in one
language, may signifie another thing in another. So that not considering
the institution or invention of this or that significancy of
several sounds in several languages, every sound, or articulate
prolation, doth naturally make a distinct and several impulse upon
the ear, and thereby the senses, and consequently the mind
are variously affected by them. And therefore the younger <em>Helmont</em>
doth give us an apposite passage, or two to this purpose, Englished
thus: “For as in those of ripe years, certain musical modulations
being heard, do often so efficaciously imprint in the
mind the Idea of the voice and tones, that diverse do sensibly feel
them for so long a time in themselves, as it were yet sounding,
that they cannot, when they would, be freed from them: From
whence also (he saith) the word <em>inchanting</em> seemeth with the Latines
and Gauls to have drawn its original. So the Idea of our
Mothers tongue impressed in infants, doth so long adhere there,
that to them about to speak afterwards, it doth as it were place,
and order the tongue, and so is the only one mistress of their speech.”
And again he saith: “If in times past there were found those, who
by the benefit of musical instruments could move and mollifie the
mind of Man various ways: How much more humane voice, if
it being moderated by prudence, do break forth from a living spirit,
shall not only have power to effect those things, but also those
that are far greater?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Having thus far largely handled this point, we shall only recapitulate
a few things, and so conclude this Treatise.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It being granted, that great effects have been produced by
words, charms, rhythmes, and tunes, we have removed all diabolical
concurrence to those effects, except what may be mental and internal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>as in all wicked persons, when they use natural means to a
wicked and evil end, and that (as we conceive) by sufficient and
convincing arguments: And especially because, where there is no
natural agent, there the Devil can operate nothing at all, and if
there be a natural agent, his concurrence is not necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. As for the force of imagination upon extraneous bodies, we
cannot in reason affirm it to be none at all, neither dare, or will we
assert that its power (in that respect) is so vastly great, as many do
pretend.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. And for what strange effects soever, that are true and real,
that do follow upon the use of words, charms, characters, rhythms,
and the like, we do confidently affirm, that they are effected by
lawful and natural means, but withal that of this sort in this age,
few or none are found out that are efficacious. But that error, credulity,
ignorance and superstition do put great force, and stress upon
these things, when really they produce no effects at all.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>“Who upon Oath informeth, being examined concerning
the great meeting of the Witches of <em>Pendle</em>, saith that
upon <em>All-Saints-day</em> last past, he this Informer being
with one <em>Henry Parker</em> a near door-neighbour to him in <em>Wheatleylane</em>,
desired the said <em>Parker</em> to give him leave to gather some
Bulloes which he did; In gathering whereof he saw two Grayhounds,
<em>viz.</em> a black and a brown; one came running over the
next field towards him, he verily thinking the one of them to be
Mr. <em>Nutters</em>, and the other to be Mr. <em>Robinsons</em>, the said Gentlemen
then having such like. And saith, the said Grayhounds
came to him, and fawned on him, they having about their necks
either of them a Collar, unto each of which was tied a string: which
Collars (as this Informer affirmeth) did shine like Gold. And he
thinking that some either of Mr. <em>Nutters</em> or Mr. <em>Robinsons</em>, Family
should have followed them; yet seeing no body to follow
them, he took the same Grayhounds thinking to course with
them. And presently a Hare did rise very near before him. At
the sight whereof he cried, Loo, Loo, Loo: but the Doggs
would not run. Whereupon he being very angry took them,
and with the strings that were about their Collars, tied them to
a little bush at the next hedge, and with a switch that he had in
his hand he beat them. And in stead of the black Grayhound
one <em>Dickensons</em> Wife stood up, a Neighbour whom this Informer
knoweth. And instead of the brown one a little Boy, whom this
Informer knoweth not. At which sight this Informer being afraid,
endeavoured to run away: but being stayed by the Woman
(<em>viz.</em>) by <em>Dickensons</em> Wife, she put her hand into her pocket,
and pulled forth a piece of Silver much like to a fair shilling, and
offered to give him it to hold his tongue and not to tell: which
he refused, saying, Nay thou art a Witch. Whereupon she put
her hand into her pocket again, and pulled out a thing like unto
a Bridle that gingled, which she put on the little Boyes head:
which said Boy stood up in the likeness of a white Horse, and in
the brown Grayhounds stead. Then immediately <em>Dickensons</em>
Wife took this Informer before her upon the said Horse and carried
him to a new house called <em>Hoarstones</em> being about a quarter
of a mile off. Whither when they were come, there were divers
persons about the door, and he saw divers others riding on
Horses of several colours towards the said House, who tied their
Horses to a hedge near to the said House. Which persons went
into the said House, to the number of threescore or thereabouts,
as this Informer thinketh, where they had a fire, and meat roasting
in the said House, whereof a young Woman (whom this Informer
knoweth not) gave him Flesh and Bread upon a Trencher
and Drink in a Glass, which after the first tast he refused and
would have no more, but said, it was naught.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And presently after, seeing divers of the said company going
into a Barn near adjoining, he followed after them, and there he
saw six of them kneeling, and pulling all six of them six several ropes,
which were fastened or tied to the top of the Barn. Presently
after which pulling, there came into this Informers sight flesh
smoaking, butter in lumps, and milk as it were flying from the
said ropes. All which fell into basons which were placed under
the said ropes. And after that these six had done, there came other
six which did so likewise. And during all the time of their
several pulling they made such ugly faces as scared this Informer,
so that he was glad to run out and steal homewards: who immediately
finding they wanted one that was in their company, some
of them ran after him near to a place in a High-way called <em>Boggard-hole</em>,
where he this Informer met two Horsemen. At the
sight whereof the said persons left following of him. But the
foremost of those persons that followed him, he knew to be one
<em>Loind</em>’s Wife: which said Wife together with one <em>Dickensons</em>
Wife, and one <em>Jennet Davies</em> he hath seen since at several times
in a Croft or Close adjoining to his Fathers house, which put
him in great fear. And further this Informer saith, upon <em>Thursday</em>
after <em>Newyears-day</em> last past, he saw the said <em>Loind</em>’s Wife
sitting upon a cross piece of wood being within the Chimney of
his Fathers dwelling house: and he calling to her, said Come
down thou <em>Loynd</em>’s Wife. And immediately the said <em>Loynd</em>’s
Wife went up out of his sight. And further this Informer saith,
that after he was come from the company aforesaid to his Fathers
house, being towards evening, his Father bad him go and fetch
home two Kine to seal. And in the way in a field called the <em>Ellers</em>,
he chanced to hap upon a Boy, who began to quarrel with
him, and they fought together, till the Informer had his ears and
face made up very bloody by fighting, and looking down he saw
the Boy had a cloven foot. At which sight he being greatly affrighted,
came away from him to seek the Kine. And in the way
he saw a light like to a Lanthorn towards which he made haste, supposing
it to be carried by some of Mr. <em>Robinsons</em> people; but
when he came to the place, he only found a Woman standing
on a Bridge, whom when he saw he knew her to be <em>Loind</em>’s
Wife, and knowing her he turned back again: and immediately
he met with the aforesaid Boy, from whom he offered to run,
which Boy gave him a blow on the back that made him to cry.
And further this Informer saith, that when he was in the Barn,
he saw three Women take six Pictures from off the beam, in
which Pictures were many Thorns or such like things sticked in
them, and that <em>Loynd</em>’s Wife took one of the Pictures down,
but the other two Women that took down the rest he knoweth
not. And being further asked what persons were at the aforesaid
meeting, he nominated these persons following, <em>viz.</em> <em>Dickensons</em>
Wife, <em>Henry Priestleys</em> Wife, and his Lad, <em>Alice Hargreene</em>
Widow, <em>Jane Davies</em>, <em>William Davies</em>, and the Wife of <em>Henry
Fackes</em>, and her Sons <em>John</em> and <em>Miles</em>, the Wife of&#160;&#8196;&#8196;&#8196; <em>Denneries</em>,
<em>James Hargreene</em> of <em>Marsdead</em>, <em>Loynd</em>’s Wife, one <em>James</em>
his Wife, <em>Saunders</em> his Wife, and <em>Saunders</em> himself <i><span lang="la">sicut credit</span></i>,
one <em>Laurence</em> his Wife, one <em>Saunder Pyn</em>’s Wife of <em>Barraford</em>,
one <em>Holgate</em> and his Wife of <em>Leonards</em> of the West close.”</p>

found him so affrighted and distracted, that he neither knew his
